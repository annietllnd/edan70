   "text": "For purity control of isolated pmATII cells, IF staining was performed on cells cultured overnight on chamber slides (BD Bioscience). Cells were subsequently fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), and blocked with 3 % (w/vol) bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies (proSFTPC (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), panCK (Dako, Hamburg, Germany), T1α (Podoplanin; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, US), CD45 (BD Bioscience), CD31 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), αSMA (Sigma Aldrich)) were diluted in PBS containing 0.1 % (w/vol) BSA and incubated for 1 h at RT. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (polyclonal goat anti-mouse FITC, Dako, Hamburg, Germany; goat anti-rabbit Alexa 555 or goat anti-rat Alexa 555, both Life Technologies) were diluted in PBS containing 0.1 % (w/vol) BSA and incubated for 1 h at RT. DAPI staining (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was performed to visualize cell nuclei.",
