   "text": "Cellular BAL fluid profiles and distributions of BAL fluid cell counts in the two groups are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 . Detailed data of each patient are summarized in Table S1 . The median total WBC count (2,815/mL vs. 300/mL, P,0.001), percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02), and absolute neutrophil count (2,661/mL vs. 204/mL, P,0.001) of BAL fluid were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. The median serum procalcitonin concentration was also higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (1.9 ng/ml vs. 0.3 ng/ml, P = 0.02), and the C-reactive protein concentration tended to be higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (20.3 mg/dL vs. 14.9 mg/dL, P = 0.09).",
