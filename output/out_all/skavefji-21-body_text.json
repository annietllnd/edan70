Stolz et al [11] . evaluated potential markers of bacterial infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications. They reported that the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the serum procalcitonin concentration are independent predictors of bacterial infection. They suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is 15% (sensitivity 84%; specificity 77%), which is much lower than the cutoff value in the current study. Sternberg et al. [13] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing pneumonia in renal transplant patients, and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is .20% for predicting bacterial pneumonia. However, neither of these previous studies included patients with severe pneumonia caused by respiratory viruses alone, and both compared BAL findings between patients with bacterial pneumonia and those with non-infectious diseases. In the current study, patients with viral pneumonia were included by using the newly developed multiplex respiratory virus RT-PCR. This showed that cases of viral pneumonia were frequently associated with neutrophilia in BAL fluid (median 54.0%). We speculate that this underlies why the optimal cutoff value of percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid for predicting bacterial pneumonia is much higher in the current study (64%, Table 4 ) than in previous studies. Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilateral lung infiltrates. A cutoff value of $60% neutrophils in BAL fluid is useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia from other causes of pneumonia or non-infectious diseases (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI; 0.54-0.84, P = 0.001) [12] . In comparison to this previous study, the current study did not include patients with non-infectious diseases or fungal pneumonia, included much more cases of severe viral pneumonia, and analyzed the counts of various cell types.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":101,"end":110}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":706,"end":715}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":869,"end":878}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":953,"end":962}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1063,"end":1072}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1155,"end":1164}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1276,"end":1285}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1489,"end":1498}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1916,"end":1925}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1947,"end":1956}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":2154,"end":2163}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":2206,"end":2215}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}]}
