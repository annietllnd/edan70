The burden is greatest in developing countries, at an estimated 0.22 episodes per child-year, but remains a major public health concern even among developed countries where there are an estimated 0.015 episodes per child-year [2] . In the USA, pneumonia is the second only to newborn infant births as the most common reason for hospital admissions (36 cases per 10 000 persons [3] ) and causes nearly 50 000 deaths each year [4] .",
