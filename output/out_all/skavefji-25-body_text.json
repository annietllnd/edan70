{"cord_uid":"skavefji", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC4019586", "divid":25, "text":"The study has several limitations. First, the small sample size of the select critically ill patient population analyzed limits the general applicability of our findings. Moreover, since our study included critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy, our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe pneumonia patients in clinical practice. Second, the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin, remains to be further elucidated. Third, cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and mycobacterial pneumonia, were not included, mainly because few patients had these types of pneumonia. Fourth, patients with non-infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates that can often mimic infectious causes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and drug-induced pneumonitis, were also excluded from our analyses. The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria. Finally, all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid. Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means, such as blood culture, endotracheal aspirates culture, urinary pneumococcal antigen test, and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples, as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was demonstrated. Therefore, patients with coincidental upper respiratory infections or colonization may have been included.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":274,"end":283}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":390,"end":399}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":676,"end":685}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":705,"end":714}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":782,"end":791}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":970,"end":979}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":994,"end":1003}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":916,"end":936}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":525,"end":537}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019586/"}]}
