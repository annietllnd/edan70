Sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, polytrauma, and aspiration pneumonia are the most common causes of ARDS [1] . Predictors of survival include age, the type of underlying medical condition, the severity of pulmonary injury, the presence of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and ongoing sepsis [2] . Currently, clinical attempts to rescue ARDS patients include individualized ventilation and fluid management, adequate infection control, including early application of broad-spectrum anti-infectives, neuromuscular blockade using cisatracurium, sedation strategies, prone positioning, and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to ensure oxygenation [3] [4] [5] . Although the incidence of ARDS is relatively high, with five to eight cases per 100,000 European inhabitants and even more in the USA, the various pathomechanisms are only partially understood, resulting in different experimental approaches to understand immune responses during early ARDS [6] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":164,"end":173}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5827994/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":202,"end":211}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5827994/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":6,"end":26}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5827994/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":73,"end":85}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5827994/"}]}
