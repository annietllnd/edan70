   "text": "ROS and RNS are generated in phagocytes in order to neutralise the invading organisms, having therefore an important role in the host defence mechanism. Nevertheless, their overproduction may be responsible for damage at inflammatory sites. In addition these reactive species play important roles in inflammation by being trigger elements or by being signalling messenger molecules. ROS and RNS act as modulators of protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases, membrane receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which regulate the expression of key cytokines [22] . This short review reports the potential of essential oils as antioxidants and antiinflammatory agents, as well as the in vitro mechanisms involved in such properties.",
