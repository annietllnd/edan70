   "text": "Post-weaning diarrhea is usually associated with the proliferation of one or more strains of Î²-hemolytic ETEC in the small intestine of pigs, in particular those that express fimbrial adhesins F4 (K88) or F18 [2] . Thus, small intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC is mediated by F4-or F18-specific receptors (F4R or F18R), the existence and function of which are crucial in determining the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infection [2, 7] . The genetic predisposition of the pig is primordial for the development of PWD [28] .",
