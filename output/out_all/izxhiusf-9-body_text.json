As a tertiary referral centre, we are referred children for further evaluation and treatment of persistent wheezing despite ICS treatment and anti-reflux therapy in those with demonstrated GERD. Our initial assessment includes a detailed history of disease, symptoms, signs and treatment adherence, a check for the appropriateness of treatment administration and dosage, and a thorough physical examination. In children without any apparent explanation for persistent wheezing, a work-up, including FOB + BAL is conducted. In these cases, FOB + BAL is always performed under stable condition, outside episodes of acute infection or exacerbation of respiratory symptoms.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":810,"end":830}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420249/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":46,"end":54}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420249/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":269,"end":277}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420249/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":630,"end":638}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420249/"}]}
