Howie et al. recently investigated pneumonia etiology in children in Gambia, observing that S. pneumoniae was the leading cause with a high rate of microbial agent co-detection [15] . Conversely, they found that viral pneumonia was not predominant whereas we observed that 3 viruses, namely human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus, were associated with pneumonia in Mali. Major differences between the 2 studies were sample type (lung aspirates vs. nasal swabs in our investigation) and the lack of a comparative group in the study by Howie et al. which did not permit comparison of microbial prevalence in pneumonia patients and healthy subjects [15] . In a Western Kenya case-control study, S. pneumoniae, RSV, and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of pneumonia in children [16] . We noted almost similar results in Mali. Thus, S. pneumoniae and RSV could still be considered as the primary causes of pneumonia in several sub-Sharan African countries. All patients who died had severe pneumonia, according to WHO criteria, with significant dyspnea, very marked chest indrawing and severe hypoxia. Two patients had confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia. Two patients had acute malnutrition linked with pneumonia. In 2 cases, death occurred within 24 hours of admission. Despite active treatment with antibiotics and oxygen, the management of severe respiratory distress is often difficult in this context because the hospital does not have assisted ventilatory support. Mortality was higher than in a recent birth cohort in South Africa [17] , but was similar to what was reported previously in other developing countries [18, 19] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":42,"end":51}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":110,"end":119}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":293,"end":302}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":438,"end":447}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":692,"end":701}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":851,"end":860}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1000,"end":1009}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1084,"end":1093}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1236,"end":1245}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1295,"end":1304}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1442,"end":1462}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}]}
