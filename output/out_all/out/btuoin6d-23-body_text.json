In this study, we compared the characteristics of fever in Adv and Non-Adv group patients. The Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever and a higher proportion of peak body temperature than patients infected with other various viral respiratory pathogens or unknown pathogens. Similarly, Ho et al [22] observed that viral mono-pathogen patients had a higher mean body temperature than bacterial mono-pathogen patients. In addition, dualpathogen patients, such as S. pneumoniae with either influenza A or B, had a higher mean body temperature, although not significantly different from the respective mono-pathogens. However, there is still a lack of detailed data on the specific pathogen-related clinical characteristics, especially fever, in immunocompetent patients. Thus, our data is more likely to aid physicians in determining further diagnostic or therapeutic considerations at the time of admission. We also evaluated the response to antipyretic treatment between the Adv and Non-Adv groups. Our data showed that the Adv group patients exhibited a higher proportion of individuals with no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non-Adv or unknown pathogen group patients. Weisse et al. [23] evaluated the effect of acetaminophen on fever in bacterial vs. viral infections in 100 children. They concluded that there is no correlation between a fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the fever, revealing no usefulness in the response to antipyretic treatment in predicting etiologies of pneumonia. However, our data suggest that there may be a difference in the antipyretic response to Adv compared to other etiologies, and this is the first such data reported for immunocompetent adults.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1662,"end":1671}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":65,"end":70}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":183,"end":188}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":272,"end":277}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":876,"end":881}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1395,"end":1400}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1506,"end":1511}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1562,"end":1567}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033854/"}]}
