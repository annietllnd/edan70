It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance, and protects pigs against ETEC: F4 infection by reducing the intestinal expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and interleukin-8 and maintaining mucosal integrity, and enhancing specific antibody defense [111] . Spray dried plasma (SDPP) of porcine origin has been pinpointed as a potential source for the coronavirus in a recent epidemic of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) [136] . Thus, spray-dried chicken plasma (SDCP) has been evaluated as a replacement for SDPP in weaned pigs. Indeed, the effect of SDCP on serum biochemistry, intestinal barrier function, immune parameters, and the expression of intestinal development-related genes in piglets was similar to SDPP [137] . Nevertheless, a study has provided evidence that PED virus is inactivated during the SDPP production process [138] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":578,"end":586}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437690/"}]}
