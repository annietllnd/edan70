Ours is the first case-control investigation of pneumonia etiology in children from Mali (S1 STROBE checklist). The results should serve to better manage pneumonia not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries. Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory (Lyon, France). In addition, this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of pneumonia and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents. Some limitations should be underlined. First, microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult due to the lack of single reliable test. Then, at the individual level, it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization; particularly for bacterial agents such as S. pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage. However, at the population level, addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children. In a pneumonia etiology study, it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from RT-PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of pneumonia, according to the microorganism [30] . Second, because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali, external validity might be limited. However, Gabriel Tour√© University Hospital is a reference center in the country, and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako. Third, study power was confined to detecting some linkages (i.e. serotypes associated with the risk of pneumonia).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[{"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":119,"end":128}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":277,"end":286}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":383,"end":392}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":654,"end":663}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":727,"end":736}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":878,"end":887}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1331,"end":1340}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1564,"end":1573}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}, {"id":"Symptom_Covid-19", "span":{"begin":1965,"end":1974}, "obj":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687909/"}]}
