   "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia was mainly attributable to S. pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, RSV or influenza A among children in Mali. Increased pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage in children would significantly reduce the burden of pneumonia in this country. The addition of a control group to assess etiologies of pneumonia in children is critical to properly interpret the microbiological results of diagnostic testing with high sensitivity.",
