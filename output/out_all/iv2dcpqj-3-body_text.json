   "text": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), together with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV), is a member of the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae and an important pathogen of pigs that often causes huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 12.3 kb. The RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein, flanked by a 5 1 -untranslated region (UTR) and a 3 1 -UTR. Under cellular and viral protease processing, the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins, including four structural proteins (C, E rns , E1 and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (N pro , p7, NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [1] [2] [3] . The 5 1 -UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is responsible for translation initiation of the viral genome [4] . The 3 1 -UTR is in charge of regulating the pestiviral genome replication [5, 6] .",
