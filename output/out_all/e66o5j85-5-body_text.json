   "text": "Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a under-five year mortality rate of 123 per 1,000 live births in 2013 according to the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. It has been estimated that among its 14.9 million inhabitants, each year more than 900,000 pneumonia episodes occur in children under 5 years of age, leading to almost 8,000 deaths annually [7] . A previous descriptive study reported that pneumonia was the most frequent cause of admission, representing 18% of total hospital admissions [8] . However, detailed information was not available on clinical presentation and on the etiology of suspected pneumonia cases [8] . Moreover, no control group was included. The presence of a control group of children without pneumonia would allow better interpretation of microbiological findings, particularly with nasal sampling [9] . In March 2011, Mali included pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) in a routine immunization program; but vaccine coverage is still low [10] .",
