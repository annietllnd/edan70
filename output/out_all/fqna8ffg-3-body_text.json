   "text": "Black carbon, the most strongly light absorbingcomponent of particulate matter (PM), is an air pollutant increasingly discussed to affect both human health and climate change [1] . For Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source and average exposures of 6.5 ug/m 3 have been described for people in transport [2] . Black carbon is mainly present in the form of soot particles within the so-called ultrafine, nanoparticle fraction of anthropogenic air pollution, but in addition to the inhalation of combustion-derived nanoparticles, the workplace can also be an important site of exposure in the case of manufacture of carbon black. Due to its small size, inhaled carbonaceous nanoparticles (CNP) have been described to effectively penetrate deep into the lungs, deposit in the fragile alveolar region and might thus be more potent to induce health effects than lager particles [3] [4] [5] . Even that associations of specific sub-components of PM with adverse effects are difficult to detect for epidemiological studies, combustion-derived particles had been identified as an important component in driving adverse effects of PM already years ago [6, 7] . In this context the WHO report 2012 recognizes sufficient evidence of epidemiological studies for an association of daily variations in black carbon concentrations with short-term changes in health (here: all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and cardiopulmonary hospital admissions), and suggest BC to be a better indicator of harmful particulate substances from combustion sources (especially traffic) than undifferentiated PM mass. We and others have used carbon nanoparticles of various sources, such as Printex 90 or Sterling V to examine the underlying toxicological mechanisms in animal and human studies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . While these CNPs exhibit difficulties in the aerosolization of agglomerated black carbon powders in the ultrafine or nanosized mode (<100 nm count median diameter), freshly, lab generated CNPs have been used for inhalation studies in mice [13, 14] , rats [15] , and man [16, 17] . Depending on the focus of interest and also the doses applied, these studies describe low grade pulmonary inflammation, trombogenicity, cardiovascular impairments and alterations in the peripheral blood leukocyte distribution upon CNP exposure.",
