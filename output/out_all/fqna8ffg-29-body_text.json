   "text": "We show that pulmonary carbon nanoparticle instillation triggers acute pulmonary inflammation, with no inflammatory stimulation of alveolar macrophages, but alveolar epithelial cells during the first 12 h after exposure,-the period of the maximal induction of proinflammatory gene expression. As alveolar deposited particles are rapidly removed by phagocytic clearance from the respiratory surface, the epithelial inflammatory response seems short-lived as long as particle laden macrophages remain unstimulated. Yet inhaled materials which are difficult to clear by phagocytosis or pose toxicity and persistent stimulation to alveolar macrophages, may cause persistent inflammation and should therefore be designated more hazardous than 'low-toxicity low-solubility particles' such as carbon nanoparticles.",
