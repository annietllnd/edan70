   "text": "We observed similar results in a different context. Despite the dearth of vaccination against pneumococcus in our population, viral pneumonia is a major segment of the pneumonia burden. Treatment of these infections is often problematic because the empirical use of antibiotics or antivirals is not consensual [25] . Vaccine development, particularly against RSV, is warranted to prevent pneumonia in children. Moreover, the impact of influenza vaccine policies in developing countries should be evaluated because this virus often causes pneumonia [26] .",
