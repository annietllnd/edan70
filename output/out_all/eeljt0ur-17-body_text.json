   "text": "Chronic diarrhea was less common in this study population, with only two cats having concurrent vomiting and diarrhea and three cats with diarrhea alone. It was considered that there may have been a lack of awareness or appreciation of diarrhea in the cats given the absorptive nature of litter that could have made diarrhea less recognizable to owner. The FCS chart included images of stool within litter to help educate and increase awareness of the owners participating in this study; however, overall frequency of diarrhea remained low and did not significantly change over the 4-week period.",
