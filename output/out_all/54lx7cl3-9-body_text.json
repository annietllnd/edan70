   "text": "Lung microbiome studies suggest that bacteria colonizing the LRT overlap with those found in the URT, but that the abundance of organisms is quite low [13] , and their role in pneumonia etiology has yet to be explored. To colonize the LRT, an organism must overcome mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis by resident alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages [37, 38] , but many URT pathogens have developed strategies to overcome these barriers. H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis resist mucociliary clearance by impairing ciliary function.",
