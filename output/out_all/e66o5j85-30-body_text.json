   "text": "Some invasive serotypes were detected selectively in pneumonia cases but not in the controls (i.e., serotypes 1 and 5 were associated with the risk of pneumonia). A previous study of serotypes involved in invasive pneumococcal disease in Mali found that serotype 5 was the most prevalent (54%) [20] . It was also linked with pneumonia in our series. In other sub-Saharan African countries, serotype 1 was described as the most prevalent serotype of invasive pneumococcal disease [21] . It was the second serotype significantly associated with pneumonia in children in Mali. Thus, the introduction of PCV in routine immunization programs in Mali would substantially reduce pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae because most serotypes eliciting pneumonia would be covered by the vaccine [22] . In addition, pneumococcal pneumonia seasonality was similar to that observed previously in Burkina Faso, a neighbouring country, in 2007-2011 with higher incidence during the dry season between January and May [23] . Interestingly, among the 4 microbial agents associated with pneumonia, 3 were viruses: human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus. Self et al. recently observed, in a pneumonia cases-control study implemented in hospitals of Utah, that detection respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample of patients with pneumonia probably indicates an etiologic role [24] .",
