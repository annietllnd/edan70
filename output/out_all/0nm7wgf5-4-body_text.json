   "text": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was isolated from cells by using either TRIzol or a Quick-RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research). DENV RNA levels were estimated as described previously, using TaqMan one-step real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) (10, 11) . The amount of DENV negative-strand RNA was measured by cDNA synthesis with a forward primer followed by real-time PCR using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit with a genomic DNA (gDNA) eraser (TaKaRa). A ␤-actin primer-probe mix (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization. Fold changes were calculated by the ⌬⌬C T method.",
