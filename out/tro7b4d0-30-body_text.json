For the Triton samples the protocol listed above was followed. For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, cells were washed with a cold KHM (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 110 mM KOOCH 3 , 2 mM Mg(OOCH 3 ) 2 ) and kept on ice. The cells were permeabilized with 75 mg/ml digitonin (EM Sciences) for 10 min. The digitonin solution was removed and the cells were rinsed twice with cold KHM. The cells were moved to room temperature and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The control cells were incubated with mouse anti-Myc (1:2) and rabbit anti-GFP (1:500). The C-terminus of IBV E, ssIBV E, and FLAG-IBV E were detected using a C-terminal rat anti-IBV E antibody (1:500). The N-terminus of IBV E and ssIBV E was detected using a rabbit anti N-terminal IBV E antibody (1:100). The N-terminus of FLAG-IBV E was detected using a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:500). Secondary antibodies were The Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000), and Texas Red conjugated donkey anti-rat (1:500). DNA was stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 mg/ml).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
