The key catalytic residues characteristic of phage integrases [49] are conserved in this protein (marked with arrows in Figure 2C ). Thus, one can conclude that the enzymatic activity has been preserved. It is plausible that the introduction of this protein into Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is due to the extensive HGT that takes place in bacteria.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
