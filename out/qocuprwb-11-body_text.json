In particular, we focused on the variation of disease outcome in individual mice following extraneural infection with JEV. We first compared the pathogenicity of two JEV strains, which cause either dose-dependent or doseindependent mortality responses. We next compared severe or mild cases of mice infected with JEV exhibiting doseindependent mortality and investigated the specific host responses such as TNF-Î± and IL-10 expression in the CNS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
