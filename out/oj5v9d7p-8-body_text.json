It has been known for many years that cells can tolerate mild oxidative stress by additional synthesis of various antioxidants (GSH, thioredoxin (Trx), antioxidant enzymes, CoQ, etc.) and restoring redox antioxidant/prooxidant balance [87] . Since ROS in excess are damaging to many biological molecules, the antioxidant system network is responsible for prevention/decrease of the damages. However, these adaptive mechanisms in living organisms have limited ability. Once the ROS/RNS production exceeds the ability of the antioxidant defence system to neutralise them, oxidative stress occurs and important biological molecules, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAFAs), proteins and DNA can be damaged leading to detrimental consequences in terms of health, growth and development of poultry. Therefore, the antioxidant defence includes several options [13, 15, [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] (Figure 1 ): Figure 1 . Antioxidant defence mechanisms (adapted from Reference [13] ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
