More military campaigns have probably been lost or won due to infectious diseases than due to the tactical acumen of the armies' commanders. Thucydides reports in his History of the Peloponnesian War, written in the 5 th century BC, how the plague of Athens devastated the citystate of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year [27] ; influenza [28] ; HIV [29] ; tuberculosis [30] [31] [32] [33] ; P. falciparum malaria [34, 35] ; hepatitis B [36] ; measles [37] ; plague [38, 39] of the Peloponnesian War (430 BC) when it was on the cusp of victory against Sparta, ending the golden age of Pericles and Athenian predominance in the ancient world. The eventual fall of the Roman Empire was also largely down to another epidemic, the Justinian plague in 541-542 CE, which precluded the Emperor Justinian recovering lost territories in the western part of the empire [21] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
