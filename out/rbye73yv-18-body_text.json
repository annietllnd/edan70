Their common epitopes on the RBD include residues Val527, Ser528, Ile529, Val530, Pro531, Ser532, Trp535, Glu536 and Asp539 in the β6-β7 loop. The residues Trp535, Glu536 and Asp539 also happen to be within the DPP4-binding site patch 1 of MERS-CoV RBD [23] , mediating interaction with Lys267 and the carbohydrate moiety linked to Asn229 of DPP4 [38] . Therefore, the Group 1 antibodies would directly compete with DPP4 in binding to RBD by interfering with both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions between RBD and DPP4. Structural super-impositions also showed that these four antibodies and DPP4 would have steric clashes between the variable domain of the heavy chain and the propeller domain of DPP4 if they simultaneously bind to RBD (Figure 4(C) ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
