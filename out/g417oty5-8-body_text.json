Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon, penton base, and fiber gene of China isolates showed no substantial differences from those found in the Japanese, Korean and US isolates (bootstrap values less than 80) (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4C ). Phylogenetic analysis of fiber gene showed that this gene was highly conserved in all the HAdV-7 isolates analyzed (Fig. 4C) . However, the phylogenetic tree based on L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein indicated that the isolates circulating in China, USA, and Argentina were much closer to HAdV-16, and distinct from the HAdV-7 prototype Gomen strain (1952) (Fig. 4D) . Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of 31 available HAdV-7 whole genomes revealed that the seven HAdV-7d isolates represented an unusual clade (bootstrap value: 100) along with the other HAdV-7d strains circulating in China, including 0901/HZ/ ShX/2009, CQ1198_2010, DG01_2011 (Fig. 4E) , which was distinct from the HAdV-7d2 USA strains and the prototype Gomen strain (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D ). The overall genome sequences of these hyper-virulent isolates are very distinct.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
