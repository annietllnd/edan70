For example, a relatively large number of studies targeted university students, which might be explained by a policy focus on mental health in educational institutions and the fact that universities are a relatively convenient setting in which to target young people (the age at which many mental health problems have their first onset). This lays a foundation for developing interventions to assist members of the public to help others with mental health problems in the community. As the Chinese mental health system faces considerable challenges due to the increasing numbers of people seeking help for mental disorders [3, 9] and the severe shortage of mental health professionals [48] , such interventions could play a role in building capacity in non-mental health professionals and empower community members to work together to improve population mental health [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
