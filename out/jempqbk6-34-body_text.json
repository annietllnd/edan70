Viral helicases of superfamily 3 have significant similarity to several human proteins, in particular the human AAA+ ATPase Tip49b (DALI Z-scores between 7.3 and 8.5, RMSD between 3.2 Å and 3.7 Å; Supplementary Figure S3 ). The function of these proteins as ATP-dependent hydrolases is also similar. Superfamily 1 and 2 helicases are also known to be conserved in cellular organisms, including bacteria and humans [70] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
