Although we did not demonstrate cleavage of MHV S at the FP proximal position directly, a recent study found a cleaved form of the MHV S2 subunit to correspond with the fusion-active form [49] . Furthermore, introduction of an optimal FCS at the FP proximal position abolished the entry inhibition by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor whilst introducing a dependency on furin-related enzymes. Consistent with the known presence of active furin in early endosomes (reviewed in [78] ) the mutant virus no longer required trafficking to late endosomes/lysosomes for entry to occur. However, in the presence of furin inhibitor, entry of this mutant MHV was much more efficient in wild type cells than in cells lacking a functional HOPS complex (Fig. 8) , indicating that under certain circumstances lysosomal proteases may play a role in entry of this virus as well. Trafficking of virions to lysosomes was shown to be also important for entry of FIPV, but not of MERS-CoV, in agreement with the latter virus containing a putative FCS immediately upstream of the FP. Correspondingly, entry of FIPV was inhibited by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI but not by furin inhibitor, while the reciprocal held true for MERS-CoV. The importance of S protein cleavage downstream of the S1/S2 boundary and upstream of the FP for infection has so far only been demonstrated for SARS-CoV and IBV [40, 43, [46] [47] [48] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
