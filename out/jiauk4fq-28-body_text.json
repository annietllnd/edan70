The changes indicative of this activation were an enlarged and deformed shape of the cells, a partial or total decrease in granule numbers and a dilation of the open canalicular system. The most common form of platelet aggregation was the appearance of mosaic-like clusters comprising fully degranulated platelets with fusion of cytoplasmic membranes. Occasionally, these membranes completely disappeared, giving rise to a finely granular structure with low electron density, containing vestiges of platelet organelles and surrounded by a membrane layer. In the BVDV/BHV-1 group, platelet aggregation occurred sooner and was more intense, increasing between 4 and 7 dpi ( Figure 4A ) and not showing a total recovery at the end of the study ( Figure 4C ). In the BHV-1 group this lesion was moderate, presenting retrieval signs from 7 dpi ( Figure 4B, 4D) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
