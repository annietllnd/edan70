All groups exhibited increased levels of inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ and IL-2, but not IL-4 and IL-5 in the brain cortex compared with the uninfected group (UG) ( Figure 3B) . Interestingly, the level of TNF-α in the SG was significantly increased when compared with those in the MHG and MLG ( Figure 3B ). The level of IL-10 in the SG was also significantly higher than in the MLG ( Figure 3B ). Although the difference was not significant, the level tended to be higher than that recorded in the MHG ( Figure 3B ). On the other hand, IFN-γ did not show significant differences between the three groups, and IL-2 levels in the SG were lower than in the MHG ( Figure 3B ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
