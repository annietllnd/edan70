Following the theme of observations made with restriction factors, species-specific patterns of RanBP2 interaction exist, and these patterns depend on the specific virus that is being tested. We show that, in at least two instances involving African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas), the natural cross-species transmission of SIV to these species coincided with viral adaptation to interact with their RanCyp. Adaptation to bind RanCyp seems to have been an important evolutionary event that allowed SIV to jump into and then between great ape species, or that refined interactions with apes after these jumps occurred. While the importance of the RanCyp-capsid interaction has been debated, its restoration after two important cross-species transmission events lends credibility to its importance, particularly in the lineage of SIV that entered apes and ultimately humans to become HIV-1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
