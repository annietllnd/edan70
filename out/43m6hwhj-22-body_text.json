Previous reports described already some interactions between PRRSV and ISGs, like inhibition of ISIG15 [36] and PKR [37] functions. Unfortunately, still little is known about particular interactions between PRRSV and ISGs like OAS, IFIT1 or Mx1. Recently Badaoui et al. [38] described up-regulation of OAS1 expression in LV-infected PAMs. In addition, Zhao and co-workers [39] observed in an in vitro system that PRRSV infection led to induction of OAS1, while knockdown of endogenous OAS1 increased the PRRSV mRNA In our analysis also other genes from OAS family were observed to be strongly up-regulated. OAS2 gene showed increased expression in BOR and ILI groups, while OASL gene was found to be up-regulated in all three groups of infected animals. Those observations suggest the involvement of OAS proteins in various mechanisms engaged in the defense against PRRSV infection, also observed in studies of other viral infections [40] [41] [42] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
