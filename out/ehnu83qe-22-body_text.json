The mean serum value was 253.58 ± 0.49, and the mean grayscale value of serum minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 136.1 (P = 2.8×10 −5 ), indicating that CMV antibodies were abundant in the serum samples. This was consistent with the ELISA results (Table A in S2 File).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
