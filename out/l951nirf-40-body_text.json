The lack of correlation between H5 M1 gene mixed VLP and broad crossreactivity might suggests that combination of M1 gene from H5 strain with full length of HA and NA genes from H1 strain was not well-matched to induce broad-spectrum humoral immune response in our baculovirus DNA delivery system [39, 41] . Therefore, we sought the key to the enhanced breadth of the neutralizing spectrum of AcHERV-VLP is the inclusion of pivotal immunogenic genes. For example, it has been shown that addition of the extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) and several other HA genes can increase the breadth of neutralizing antibodies [42] [43] [44] [45] . IFN-γ screening in immunized mice showed that, AcHERV-VLP immunization induced stronger IFN-γ related cellular immune response in splenocyte than AcHERV-HA immunization, which indicates that VLP-forming baculovirus presented more T cell epitopes from NA and M1 proteins, and those epitopes triggered stronger cellular responses than that of HA only by stimulating with whole killed influenza virus (Fig 4. ) [38] . Th1 stimulating VLP forming DNA vaccine contains major T cell epitopes in VLP forming components. Not only HA but also influenza NA and M1 protein have conserved CD8+ T cell epitopes [46, 47] . Therefore, VLP forming AcHERV-VLP presented more T cell epitopes to cellular immune cells than HA protein targeted AcHERV-HA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
