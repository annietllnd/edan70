The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the total knowledge score for the baseline study participant was 18.0 (6.0). Most of the respondents were aware of the etiology, risk factors, and transmission of respiratory tract infections, as summarized in Table 2 . However, 54.2% of the pilgrims held misunderstanding that allergies caused RTIs. Only 23.1% and 25.8% of the participants were aware that RTI could result in multi-organ failure and breathing difficulties, respectively. Knowledge was good for responses pertaining to questions relating to the effectiveness and re-use of a face mask. The participants also knew that respiratory tract infections could be transmitted through the air (85.3%). Surprisingly, 60.9% of the participants thought RTIs could be spread by water. The correct answers to questions on the effectiveness of a cloth face mask compared to a two-ply surgical face mask and the re-use of used face masks stored in bags for later use were 77.3 and 76.4%, respectively. Regarding the knowledge of preventive practices of RTIs, most of the participants (81.3%) knew RTIs could be prevented by following a healthy diet (89.8%), receiving vaccinations (83.1%), washing hands with hand sanitizers (87.1%) and wearing a face mask (90.7%). However, covering the nose with hands as a protective measure was known by only 32.0% of the participants.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
