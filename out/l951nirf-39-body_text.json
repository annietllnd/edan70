Also, among sera obtained from variously immunized mice, only sera from AcHERV-VLP-immunized mice exhibited cross-reactivity against the H1N1 PR8 strain, which has 81.6%, 61.5% and 96.4% homology with the pH1N1 HA, NA and M1 protein, respectively (Fig 3B and 3C) . Generally, VLP has an identical structure as a virus, and functions as a mimic antigen [24, 26] . Hence, the advantage of VLP vaccine has been described in conformational way; especially it presents more optimal neutralizing epitopes than that of HA only. Also, AcHERV-VLP includes M1 protein as a VLP component and recent publication indicates that M1 protein contains highly conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing cross-reactivity [37, 40] . Thus, AcHERV-VLP induced enhanced antibody response for both of homologous H1 and heterologous H1, whereas AcHERV-HA could not.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
