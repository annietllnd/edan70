Currently, molecular approaches include traditional Sanger DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), oligonucleotide microarrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Among these four technologies, the former two can identify a few known pathogens that must then be confirmed individually, and thus cannot cover a wide range of pathogens. The latter two methods cover a broad range of pathogens, and are therefore suitable for identifying unknown or even novel pathogens in infectious outbreaks. Although NGS produces the most in-depth, unbiased information, and can reveal completely novel organisms, it is time-consuming and expensive, especially for the analysis of complex samples [6] . DeRisi and colleagues developed the first generation of microarray platform, called ViroChip, to detect a wide range of viruses [7] . In 2003, the ViroChip helped to characterize SARS as a novel Coronavirus [8] . Since then, ViroChip has also been used to detected a human metapneumovirus [9] , a novel influenza virus [10] , and a novel adenovirus [11] . More recently, GreeneChip and MDA microarrays have been developed, which are broader spectrum approaches that can detect several thousand pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa [12, 13] . The aforementioned three platforms all used long oligonucleotide probes and random amplification of nucleic acids.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
