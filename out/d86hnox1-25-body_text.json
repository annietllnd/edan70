Sense/antisense amino acid (aa) types for overlapping codons, F = −2 reading frame. The relation between the sense/antisense overlapping codons and the nucleotide numbers are defined in Fig. 6 . ( Fig. 7 , right), many of the viral trends are confirmed, even though this set contains just 13 viral proteins out of 50. Thus, there are codon choices that are more favorable for dual genes, and the corresponding trends are especially visible in the most successful viral proteins. Finally, given the high success rate for dual gene design and the generality of our algorithm, we used it (with slight adjustments) to design 200 triple genes, with three proteins X, Y, Z coded in a fully-overlapping manner. Taking X as the reference, we chose to code Y on the antisense strand in the F = −2 frame and Z on the sense strand in the F = 1 frame. We tested 20,000 triplets where the corresponding pairs gave high-scoring dual genes. This led to a high success rate: more than 60% of the triplets gave −log E p > 10. We obtained 200 triplets where all three E-values (X′, Y′, Z' vs. X, Y, Z, respectively) were better than 10 −20 . Of these, 62 were triplets of non-viral proteins, 30 were triplets of viral proteins, and 40 involved one viral and two non-viral proteins. The DNA and protein sequences for one triplet are shown in Fig. 5 . X is bovine, Y is viral, and Z is a bovine tick protein. The E-values vs. Swissprot for the predicted homologs X′, Y′, and Z' were, respectively, 10 −24 , 10 −23 , and 10 −23 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
