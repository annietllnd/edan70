However, aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation or chronic inflammation can also lead to severe pathological injury. Accordingly, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its associated inflammation is a double-edged sword for host to defense viral infection. Modulating the NLRP3 inflammasome activity can prove to be a promising strategy for the intervention of viral diseases. In a juvenile mouse model of IAV infection, MCC950, a specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, ameliorates severe NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated lung injury without impairing viral clearance (76) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
