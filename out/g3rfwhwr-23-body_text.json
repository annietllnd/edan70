High levels of aminoacid sequence similarity were observed for various adenoviral proteins, including the penton (E value = 0.0002, identity = 100%), penton base (E value = 0.0007, identity = 100%) and pIV (E value = 7e-09, identity = 94%) proteins. Two other sequences were found to be similar to sequences from recently described bat adenovirus isolates, with one contig sequence (114 nt, 84 aa) identified as related to bat adenovirus 2 in BLASTx analysis (E value = 4.7, identity = 47%), and a read sequence (76 nt) matching the bat adenovirus TJM in a BLASTn search (E value = 3e-17, identity = 92%) [56, 57] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
