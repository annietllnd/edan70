In auto-immuneprone mice (MRL), poly (IC) administration induced chronic pancreatitis [129] and aggravated lupus nephritis [130] . TLR3 up-regulation has also been reported to promote proinflammatory autoimmune responses, islet destruction, diabetes and hepatic disease [131] [132] [133] . In contrast, systemic application of poly (IC) or R-848 (a TLR7 ligand) during the sensitization phase abolished all features of experimental asthma, including airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic airway inflammation. Additionally, administration to animals with already established primary allergic responses revealed a markedly reduced secondary response following allergen aerosol rechallenge [134] . Poly (IC) administration suppressed immune complex-mediated experimental arthritis in mice with suppression dependent on type I IFNs that inhibited synovial cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokine production [135] . However, other studies of rheumatoid arthritis patients suggested that poly (IC) upregulated TLR3 expression and activation in synovial fluid fibroblasts and stimulated proinflammatory gene expression, suggesting that RNA released from necrotic cells might act as an endogenous TLR3 ligand in rheumatoid arthritis [136] . Intraarticular poly (IC) administration induced arthritis, mediated by IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signalling, as early as 3 days postadministration [137] . Thus the potential link between TLR up-regulation and autoimmunity emphasizes the need for caution in using TLR agonists as new therapies or vaccine adjuvants [131] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
