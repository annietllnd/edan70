There are very few examples where a host antibody response readily recognises a glycan component of viral glycoproteins. However, there are contexts where such phenomena have been observed. The two most characterised examples, HIV-1 and Dengue, reveal varied mechanisms to how these glycan-binding antibodies can arise. In the case of HIV-1 the chronic nature of infection enables, the eventual evolution of antibodies, capable of recognising conserved glycan features on the envelope spike. Whereas in Dengue virus, antibodies have been isolated that target structurally integral glycans. In both cases the challenge when exploiting these potential vulnerabilities in vaccine design is that precursor B-cells exhibiting the required glycan specificities are negatively selected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
