The 8a protein was included to determine its potential relevance in the absence of the other viroporins, showing a significant impact on viral growth under conditions in which 3a protein or E protein was absent. In contrast, we observed that SARS-CoV was not viable when both the 3a and E proteins were absent but that its viability was rescued by the presence of either 3a or E. We showed that the E protein could compensate for the loss of the other viroporin providing that it carried a functional PBM (Fig. 10A) , a conclusion reinforced by the results obtained with five different recombinant viruses. Even more biologically relevant was the rapid reversion of a stop codon introduced 9 aa upstream of the carboxy terminus of the E protein in mutant ΔPBM. Reversion was identified only in this mutant, presumably because reversion of a single altered codon occurs more easily than the 4-aa changes in E-PBM Ϫ or the deletions performed (Fig. 10A) . Our results also showed that a 3a protein carrying a PBM could compensate for the loss of E protein and could restore virus replication but not virulence ( Fig. 10B and 11) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
