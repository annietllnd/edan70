Data were assessed to calculate mean Â± standard error values and were analyzed with the SAS System for Windows, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Chi-square analysis was employed for the estimation of platelet aggregation Factor-VIII-positive for which a p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant, using a Fisher's exact test in the instance of an expected value below 5. The Duncan's Multiple Range Test (p < 0.05) was used to analyze significant differences of the values in the same group at various time points (*) and non-paired Student's t-test (p < 0.05) was used between both inoculated groups at the same time point (**).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
