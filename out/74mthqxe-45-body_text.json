GP histograms were characterized by the presence of two Gaussian distributions. After highlighting the corresponding pixels in the images, it was possible to couple the first Gaussian distribution (centered at lower GP values) with the intracellular membranes of the cell, and the second distribution (centered at higher GP values) with the plasma membranes [70] . The two histogram distributions were used to calculate the averaged GP values of intracellular and plasma membranes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
