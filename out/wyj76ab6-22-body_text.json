This implies that at least 69 trials are necessary to successfully infect 50 % of 100 wells. Therefore this factor is needed to calculate the TCID 50 . In addition, if the Poisson formula is used, the dilution factor of the prediluted sample should be considered.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
