Especially in respiratory samples, ribosomal RNA is massively present, over 80% of all sequence reads derived from a clinical sample originate from this material [9] . Sequence reads from fecal samples can be dominated by bacterial or dietary components. A method for focusing sequencing on immunogenic viruses was sought.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
