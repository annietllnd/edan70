All of the 3a point mutants caused severe disease with 100% mortality by 6 dpi, similarly to mice infected with the wt parent and in contrast to those infected with the Δ3a variant, which survived (Fig. 6B ). No compensatory mutations restoring IC activity were identified in this experiment, further confirming that protein 3a IC activity was not essential for SARS-CoV virulence in the mouse model used.
