To identify cellular factors involved in Vpu function, we carried out yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using full-length Vpu as bait (for details, see experimental procedures). We identified five Vpu-interacting proteins, including SGTA, which was previously reported to bind Vpu 25 . Callahan et al. previously observed that SGTA overexpression inhibited HIV-1 release, but the mechanism of action was not established. Also, this previous study was performed before tetherin was identified as the key cellular protein counteracted by Vpu to stimulate virus release. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of SGTA in Vpu-mediated tetherin degradation and HIV-1 release.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
