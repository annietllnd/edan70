Then 10 ml of enzyme solution (40 mM CVB3 3C protease in 100 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer solution, pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA) was added and the plate was shaken for 2 min at 1,400 r.p.m. Afterwards, 0.5 ml of a DMSO solution of the electrophilic probe and 0.5 ml of a DMSO solution of the nucleophile was added, followed by 10 ml of substrate solution (10 mM in 100 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer solution, pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA). The plate was shaken again for 2 min at 1,400 r.p.m. and the generated fluorescence signal was measured with a Safire II Fluorimeter from Tecan. The electrophilic probe 1 was used at a concentration of 400 mM for the screening, which lowered the protease activity by 10-20%. Eight-hundred fifty primary amines were tested at a concentration of 320 mM and fragment 2 amplified the inhibitory activity of 1 most potently. Positive control samples contained only DMSO instead of the probe or the nucleophile. Negative control samples contained no active enzyme. An interfering fluorescent effect has not been observed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
