{"cord_uid":"ocr1ttcz", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC6076265", "divid":20, "text":"The dynamics of viremia were monitored every 3-4 days until day 24 after ZIKV challenge (except the pCI-prM-E group which was only monitored at days 3 and 7) and detected by real-time RT-PCR. For the unvaccinated challenged controls, the peak of viremia was observed at day 3, declined by days 7 and 10, and cleared by day 14 (Fig. 4a) . This was consistent with previous observations that ZIKV only causes transient viremia in BALB/c mice 17, 30 . Similarly, mice in the rVSV-G1670A and rVSV-G1670A-E groups developed viremia, shedding an average of 3.7 logs of ZIKV PFU equivalent RNA/ml in blood samples collected at day 3 post-challenge (Fig. 4a) . In contrast, viremia in most mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, and pCI-prM-E groups were under the detection limit at day 3 (3 and 4 mice in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had near detection limit level of viremia, respectively, and 1 mice in pCI-prM-E group had a high level of viremia) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In addition, viremia was under detection limit from days 7 to 24 in these groups (Fig. 4a) . Collectively, these data show that a single dose vaccination of mtdVSV-based vaccines provides protection against ZIKV-induced viremia in BALB/c mice. To determine whether VSV was persistent in the vaccinated mice, brain tissues were collected at the termination of the study for detection of VSV. No infectious VSV was detected by plaque assay in any brain tissues in any group. However, 4-5 log VSV RNAs were detected in the brains of the rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, nearly no VSV RNA was detected in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 4b) . Therefore, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is the most attenuated of these viruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
