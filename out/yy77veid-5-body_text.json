Please double-check that the standard error is merely 1%; with data that spread somewhat evenly across values from 0% to 20%, one might expect a larger standard error value. Figure 3 , a "PBS control" appears but the details of this condition do not seem to be described in the text, methods, or the figure legend. It mostly draws the attention because it induces more toxicity than many of the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the entire "methods" section of the LDH assay could be improved. Presumably 50 μL was administered in all conditions, and the 1% Triton-X100 was in a solution of water (not PBS?), but it would be helpful to state these things explicitly.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
