The fluctuating case definition may partially explain the slowing down observed in the data that result in the GLM and Richards model predicting extinction. The kink in the Zhejiang data may suggest a case definition change around 6 February 2020, which would partially explain a decrease in the new daily cases reported. The slowing in cases after 6 February is apparent in both Guangdong and Zhejiang. This pattern must be interpreted with caution; it is not entirely clear whether this is a true decline in transmission, or if it is an artificial decline due to the changing case definition. Therefore, the subepidemic model forecasts likely better capture both possibilities. Additionally, on 14 February 2020, China officially reported that 1716 healthcare workers have been infected with the disease, suggesting ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
