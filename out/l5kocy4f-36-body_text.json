HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-eVP40 plus mCherry-LC3 and either BAG3-WT or vector alone, and cells were monitored by Leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope at 24 hrs post-transfection. Cell nuclei were stained by NucBlue live cell ready probes (LIFE THCHONOLOGIES). The intracellular localization of GFP-eVP40, mCherry-BAG3, and mCherry-LC3 in the live cells were imaged using XYZ scanning. To generate series images through the whole cell, serial optical planes of focus (at approximately 1Î¼m intervals) were taken through the Z stacks from the top to bottom of the cell, and the collected images were merged into one using the Leica microsystems (LAS AF) software.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
