Virus movements were manually tracked in x/y or z direction in the green channel using the MTrackJ plugin. Tracks were saved and subsequently loaded onto the red channel. For each virus spot the area underlying a circle of 0.213 mm 2 was measured for its gray mean value. Viruses were considered colocalizing if the gray mean value reached 50% of the maximum. Subsequently red and blue color channels were merged, tracks imported and viruses classified using the viral track. If the virus co-localized with the endosomal vesicle over at least four sequential 30 s frames the virus was categorized as associating. Viruses that, after initial co-localization, separated from the vesicle were classified as 'associating/dissociating'. If a virus particle faded and disappeared (and could not be found in other z-stacks) whilst co-localizing in previous intervals with an endosomal vesicle it was categorized as 'fusing' (Figure S2 and S3 in Text S1). When a viral particle co-localized with endosomal compartments but did neither dissociate nor fade during the 10 min acquisition period it was classified as 'non-fusing'. With this quantification method we analyzed 12 cells for RAB5 with 75 virions in total, 12 cells for RAB7 with 105 virions in total, and 16 cells for LAMP1 with 115 virions in total, acquired over three independent experiments.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
