The detection of an increasing number of bat-borne viruses necessitates suitable model systems for the isolation and study of these viruses. Several new cell lines from bats have been established in recent years, but so far there has been no focus on targeted generation of epithelial cells [13, 14] . Successful cultures of primary and immortalized cells of airway epithelial origin are already well established for humans and a few animal species. These include mainly equine, porcine, bovine, and mouse cell lines [22] [23] [24] [25] , but to the best of our knowledge, no characterized airway epithelial cell lines from bats exist.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
