From the perspective of folding, the major difference lies in whether the PK is formed in advance of potential secondary structure (and is more stable than the alternative secondary structure over the same interval) or is the result of fusing existing secondary structure together (extended PKs). Core PKs can also form as a result of sweeping up leftover free strand after the secondary structure has formed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
