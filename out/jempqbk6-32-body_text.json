At the structural level, we detect the similarity between the structures of the E1 hexameric helicase of the bovine Papillomavirus type 1, of the simian virus 40 initiator/helicase (both dsDNA) and of the DNA replication protein belonging to adeno-associated virus-2 (ssDNA) ( Table 2 and Figure 3E ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
