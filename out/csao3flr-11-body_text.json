Because it is present on the surface of the influenza virion, the HA glycoprotein is the primary target for developing neutralizing antibodies. However, the high variability of viral HA makes it difficult to develop a highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody. This is especially true since viral HA is able to continually evolve while maintaining surface sialic acid receptor binding capability, which leads to escape from the antibody response and is known as antigenic drift 37, 38 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
