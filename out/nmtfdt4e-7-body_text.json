While four-bank harp and mist nets were used to trap the bats (chiropterans), these devices were constructed in open spaces between trees after adapting with procedures of Jayaraj et al. [2] . In consideration, the trees should have ten meter distances, a vital criteria to construct the 50 Â 50 (2500 m 2 ) transect. Entanglement and capture of bats were carried out hourly every day after sunset and before sunrise (between 1830 and 0630). All bats were measured for size and weight using Vernier caliper and portable analytical balance (sensitivity 7 0.01 kg). Specific measurements of bats such as ear, head-body, tail, forearm, tarsus and hind foot were used to distinguish the bat identity. Descriptive measurements of bats such as forearm length and weight were used to construct the Body Condition Index adopted from Suba et al. [3] . In the presence of negative values, the body mass scale was adapted with the values and separated by 0.5 differential margins that give rise to underweight, ideal, overweight and obese. Bat identity were associated with services, dwelling locations, possible pathogen associations, guilds and roosts, climb limits and range [4, 5] . All chiropteran were released at the site of capture after data acquisition. Recapture was prevented by excluding bats with same gender and size that have hair shavings on their hind foot. The data was interpret into diversity values of Shannon, Simpson, Evenness, Menhinick and Margalef using Paleontological Statistics Software Package (PAST) v.3 because these constructs accurately profile bats by abundance, diversity and richness at each site.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
