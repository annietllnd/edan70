The first concentration was equivalent to that of MS2 (R 1 , equivalent) and the second contained 64 fold (6 Cts) more enterovirus RNA (R 2 , high). No significant difference between inhibition of MS2 rRT-PCR and enterovirus rRT-PCR was noted when equivalent amounts of enterovirus RNA was added to extracts prepared by protocols A, B and C (Fig. 2. part 2) . However, when the higher amount of enterovirus RNA was added, there was significantly less inhibition of enterovirus rRT-PCR than MS2 rRT-PCR extracts prepared using protocols B, C, and D, but not A. Thus, the decrease in MS2 rRT-PCR can serve as a measure of the amount of inhibitors in the RNA extracted by each of the extraction protocol.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
