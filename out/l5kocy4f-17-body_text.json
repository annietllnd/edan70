To examine this possibility, we utilized confocal microscopy of live HeLa cells transfected with GFP-eVP40 + BAG3-WT + mCherry-tagged human microtubule-associated light chain-3 (LC3) protein, a well-characterized marker for aggresomes ( Fig 8B) [46, 47] . Representative images of live HeLa cells once again revealed the typical pattern of GFP-eVP40 predominantly at the PM in cells expressing mCherry-LC3, but lacking expression of BAG3-WT (Fig 8B, top row) . Once again, the altered and more diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of GFP-eVP40 was observed in cells co-expressing BAG3-WT and mCherry-LC3; however, in addition, a fraction of GFP-eVP40 was observed to co-localize with mCherry-LC3 in puncta most likely representing cellular aggresomes (Fig 8B, bottom two  rows) . Together, these representative live cell confocal images suggest that the CMA function of BAG3 sequesters a fraction of eVP40 away from the PM and into aggresomes, leading to a reduction in VLP egress.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
