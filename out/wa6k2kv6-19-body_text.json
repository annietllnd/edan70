The temporal distribution of viral agents from confirmed cases tested by RT-PCR is shown in Figure 1 . Influenza viruses (FLU) were the predominant viral etiology comprising 80.5% (23.7% of the total specimens) of the confirmed cases between June 2010 and May 2011 in Beijing. Almost all of these FLU-positive specimens were FLU-A cases, which accounted for 97.0%. Conversely, two influenza B virus-positive samples were identified among the samples. All other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3%: HRV and ADV in three cases individual (1.1% of 279); HRCV in two cases (0.7%); and HRSV in one case (0.4%). HMPV, FLU-C and HPIV were not detected, even thought the primers were designed to detect these strains. In addition, seven samples (2.5% of the total number of specimens) tested positive for more than one virus or were co-infections: HRSV-A and HRV in two cases; OC43 and FLU-A in one case; HRV and FLU-A in one case; HRSV-A and FLU-A in one case; and a combination of HRSV-A, HRV and FLU-A in two cases. The identity of each virus in these co-infections was confirmed by amplification with primers specific for each virus. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
