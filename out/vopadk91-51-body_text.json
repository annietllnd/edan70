First, a lipid membrane was formed at a given salt concentration gradient. Second, one or several channels were inserted into the bilayer and a net ionic current appeared due to the concentration gradient. Third, the ionic current through the channel or channels was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current was then corrected using values corresponding to the liquid junction potentials of the electrode salt bridges (78) to obtain the final E rev .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
