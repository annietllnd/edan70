However, analysis of mutants lacking the 3a PBM showed no effect on virus production or virulence (Fig. 7) . The requirement for protein E with its PBM was dominant for SARS-CoV virulence in comparison to the requirement for protein 3a with its PBM (Fig. 11) . Furthermore, a SARS-CoV with E protein that included its PBM was virulent in the presence or absence of 3a protein PBM, whereas in the reverse situation (the presence of 3a protein with its PBM and of E protein lacking its PBM), the virus was always attenuated, reinforcing the idea of the dominance of the E protein PBM for virus pathogenicity over that of 3a protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
