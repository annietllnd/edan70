False discovery rate analysis is a robust statistical method that controls for multiple test variables by calculating an adjusted, more stringent p-value, termed a q-value [37] . (+)RNA4 levels were enhanced 1.5-to 8-fold in the 19 confirmed strains (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). Similarly, levels of (2)RNA3, the replication intermediate that serves as a template for sgRNA4, were increased 1.4-to 5-fold in these strains (Table S5) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
