Within the coronavirus family, JNK is required for persistent SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells 20 , has no effect on apoptosis induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 45 , and promotes IBVinduced apoptosis in this study. Since the outcomes are so dramatically different, we consider it scientifically important to investigate in detail the activation of JNK pathway induced by IBV, a prototype gammacoronavirus. Unlike previous studies that rely on transfection of viral proteins, we examined the activation of JNK pathway in the context of an actual infection. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is also the first study to investigate potential involvement of JNK in coronavirus-induced apoptosis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
