The cDNA of human MKK7 (RefSeq NM_145185) was amplified similarly using the forward primer 5′-CCCGGATCCATGGCGGCG TCCTCCCTGGAAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTGGTACCCTACCTGAAGAAGGGCAGGTGGGG-3′. The PCR products were digested and inserted into pXJ40-FLAG at the BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. The resulting constructs were named pXJ40-FLAG-MKK4 and pXJ40-FLAG-MKK7, respectively. The cDNA of human Bcl2 (RefSeq NM_000633) was amplified from total RNA of H1299 cells by RT-PCR using the forward primer 5′-CGCAGATCTGCGCACGCTGGGAGAACAGGGTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCACTT GTGGCCCAGATAGGCACC-3′. The PCR product was digested and inserted into pXJ40-FLAG at the BamHI and XhoI sites to generate pXJ40-FLAG-Bcl2.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
