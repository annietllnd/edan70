One factor contributing to increased losses is Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), an unexplained loss of honey bee colonies fitting a defined set of criteria [9, 10] . While factors such as pesticide exposure, transportation stress, genetic diversity, and nutrition affect colony health, the most significant CCDassociated variable characterized to date is increased pathogen incidence [10] . Although greater pathogen incidence correlates with CCD, the cause is unknown in part due to insufficient knowledge of the pathogenic and commensal organisms associated with honey bees [10, 11] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
