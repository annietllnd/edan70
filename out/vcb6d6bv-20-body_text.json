Due to their membrane embedded nature and architecture, protein-protein interactions among viroporins are thought to occur mostly through their TM segments. In order to fully understand the role of viroporins within the cell we must first identify the forces behind TM helix-helix packing. These forces are essentially the same as those driving interactions between soluble proteins. However, their contribution to the folding/packing of the protein is significantly different due to the modified environment (cytosolic vs lipidic). As mentioned before, in soluble proteins the tertiary and quaternary folding is mainly driven by the hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions. In contrast, in TM proteins van der Waals interactions have been identified as the primary force behind the helix-helix packing. One could argue that the strength of these forces/interactions is fundamentally different depending on the environment. However, that is not the case. The strength of side chain hydrogen bonds in soluble and membrane proteins is in average ~ 0.5kcal/mol and ~0.6kcal/mol respectively [70] . Similarly, the contribution of van der Waals forces to the folding of a soluble protein was estimated as 20-24 cal/mol/Å, and 18-36 cal/mol/Å for membrane proteins [71] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
