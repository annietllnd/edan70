The existence of an alternative genome has been postulated, but it has remained difficult to identify. Most methods aim to identify frameshifting events, but very few can determine which produce functional out-of-frame gene products. A summary of methods to identify frameshifting events in mRNAs and out-of-frame products is schematically shown in Figure 3 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
