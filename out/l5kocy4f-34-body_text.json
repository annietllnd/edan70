The anti-eVP40 antiserum was used to detect eVP40-WT and eVP40-ΔPT/PY mutant, and anti-flag monoclonal antibody was used to detect flag-tagged mVP40. For BAG3 titration experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.1μg of eVP40 or mVP40 and increasing amounts of BAG3-WT or BAG3-ΔC (0.1, 0.5, 1.0μg), or BAG3-ΔN (0.1 and 1.0μg). The total amounts of transfected DNA were equivalent in all samples. Supernatants and cell extracts were harvested at 24 hours post transfection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
