To demonstrate at least a 4 log 10 reduction in virus titre, it is necessary for test mixtures containing low virus titres to undergo detoxification by molecular sieving, or to use a more sensitive assay such as LVP [8] . Molecular sieving with Microspin S 400 HR columns is not the method of choice for EBOV because the process reduces the titres of these large, filamentous viruses by 1.00 to 2.00 log 10 . In LVP, a high volume of the lowest apparently non-cytotoxic dilution of the inactivation assay test mixture is added to the detector cell line and the cultures are monitored for virusspecific effects. Using this method, larger reductions in virus titre can be shown even at lower viral loads.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
