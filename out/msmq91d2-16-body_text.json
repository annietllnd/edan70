At 24 hours post transfection, cells were mock-infected or infected with 300 ml of SeV (100 U/ml), and mock-transfected or immediately transfected with 1 mg of in vitro synthesized RNA encoding CAT (control) or NSs of MP-12, PTV Adames strain or SFSV. Cells were collected at 16 hpi, and the relative luciferase activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
