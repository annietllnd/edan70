It has been proposed that dual coding limits the evolutionary flexibility of the underlying nucleotide sequence (Firth and Brown, 2006; Rancurel et al., 2009 ). Thus, one possibility may be that frameshifting occurs predominantly in highly conserved, essential genes. However, it has been argued that once a frameshift event is released from selective pressure, as occurs in gene duplication, it can evolve to produce a beneficial functional protein (Raes and Van de Peer, 2005) . Indeed, in some cases, novel genes seem to have emerged by frameshifting of a pre-existing coding sequence (Ohno, 1984; Ranz et al., 2003) . Moreover, regulated frameshifting can allow the same gene to produce alternative beneficial proteins. In fact, evolutionary studies indicate a high abundance of frameshift events in human and mouse genomes that may be linked to an increased usage of the opal TGA stop codon (Okamura et al., 2006) . It has been proposed that at least 1% of the human genome consists of dual coding regions (Michel et al., 2012) and that the number of out-of-frame peptides or proteins may be even higher than that. Other studies have suggested that ∼10% of the genome contains −1 frameshift signals (Belew et al., 2011) . I would argue that the number of frameshifted peptides or proteins is somewhere in the range of 1-10% of the genome. This is a very significant fraction of the genome, thus suggesting that out-offrame peptides are an inherent part of animal physiology and part of evolutionary selection processes. Accordingly, it can be anticipated that dual coding is regulated and a common mechanism for producing additional gene products. The main questions are:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
