Viruses were propagated in HeLa cells. Virus titer was determined by TCID 50 as described previously (Zhong et al., 2008) . To determine the interaction between CVB3 replication and cell cycle, sub-confluent cells were infected with 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of CVB3. After 1 h of absorption, the medium was removed and fresh medium containing 10% FBS was added. Cells were collected at various time points of post-infection (p.i.) for cell cycle analysis. Transfection pcDNA3.1-EGFP-VP1 (designated as pEGFP-VP1) was constructed from pcDNA3.1-EGFP (designated as pEGFP-C1) as described previously (Wu et al., 2014) . HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-VP1 or pEGFP-C1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured to 70% of confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with transfection mix (8 µg of the plasmid mixed with 10 µl of liposome in DMEM). After 4 h of incubation at 37 • C, the transfection mix was removed and fresh medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics were added. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for further analysis. Each transfection was performed in triplicate.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
