IFITM1 specific and control siRNA used in the study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the siRNA for human cells is a pool of 3 target-specific 19-25 nt siRNAs designed to knock down gene expression. According to instructions of products, we firstly prepared mixtures (0.2 μM siRNA and 7.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000) of siRNA and Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagents using Opti-MEM Media. To interfere the expression of IFITM1, cells were infected with H9N2 virus or viral particle and incubated for 1 h, then cells were covered with mixtures for 36 h at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The interference effect of IFITM1 specific siRNA was detected by western blot at 36 h postinfection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
