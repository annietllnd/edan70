Samples were placed into U9 broth, incubated at 35 ∘ C, and monitored four times daily for up to five days. A color change (indicating an alkaline pH shift) in the U9 broth prompted subculture of 100 L to an A7 agar plate. Plates were incubated anaerobically at 35 ∘ C for up to 48 hours and examined with an inverted light microscope for small, circular to irregular colonies growing into the surface of the agar, with a surrounding red zone. Confirmation of Ureaplasma species was indicated by golden-brown stained colonies with the addition of 0.167 M CO(NH 2 ) 2 and 0.04 M MnCl 2 in water. (Table 1) were designed using the LightCycler Probe Design Software, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and DNA Workbench, version 5.7.1 (CLC Bio, Cambridge, MA, USA). Positive control plasmids were constructed for the three target-specific genes (Table 1) using the pCR 2.1 TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sources for the inserted target sequences were M. hominis ATCC 23114, U. urealyticum ATCC 27618, and U. parvum ATCC 27815D. Plasmids were purified using the High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). Sizes of the cloned inserts were confirmed by EcoR1 digestion. Plasmid inserts were sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers included in the cloning kit, to confirm proper insert orientation. Plasmids were diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at 4 ∘ C.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
