Vero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™) a cell line established from Cercopithecus aethiops kidneys, were used for virus cultivation and the suspension test. The host cells were cultivated at 37°C in a humid atmosphere under 5.0 % CO 2 . The cells were fed with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated FCS and non-essential amino acids. For the virus cultivation, confluent monolayers with a maximum age of 2 days were used. Cell debris was separated by low speed centrifugation at 1,900 g for 10 min. Aliquots of the virus suspension were stored at −70°C or in liquid nitrogen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
