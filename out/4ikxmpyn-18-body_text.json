Similar to lysosomal or endosomal maturation, mitochondria damage also induces the production of ROS to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (56, 57) . The RIP1-RIP3 complex, assembled after viral infection, induces activation of the GTPase DRP1. DRP1 then translocates to the mitochondria to mediate its aberrant fission and damage (42) . It has been reported that the dengue virus, VSV, SeV, as well as poly(I:C), induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and are all dependent on the RIP1-RIP3-DRP1 pathway (42, 58) . However, reports argue that ROS, brought about by mitochondria damage, is not essential for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (59) . Instead, mitochondrial membrane potential induced by influenza or EMCV is required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Under the appropriate mitochondrial membrane potential, NLRP3 will translocate to the mitochondria to combine with mitofusin 2, a mediator of mitochondrial fusion (59) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
