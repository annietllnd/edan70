Indeed, expression of VP40 alone is sufficient to form viruslike particles (VLPs), which are morphologically indistinguishable from infectious virions and are released from mammalian cells in a manner that recapitulates the release of authentic virus [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Although not required for EBOV replication [7] , Late (L) domains (which contain PTAP and/or PPxY amino acid sequence motifs) are conserved within EBOV and MARV VP40 and promote efficient egress of VLPs and virus by recruiting host proteins that facilitate virus-cell separation [3, 4, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] . For example, EBOV and MARV VP40 L-domains hijack specific host proteins associated with the ESCRT pathway, including Tsg101, Alix, and Nedd4 [3, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
