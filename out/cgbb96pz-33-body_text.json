To generate the retroviral vectors, 293T cells were seeded at a concentration of 1x10 6 cells/well in a 6-well dish. 24 hours later each well was transfected with 2 μg pLPCX construct (empty or encoding the gene fragment of interest), 1 μg pCS2-mGP encoding MLV gag-pol [49] , and 0.2 μg pC-VSV-G at a final 1:3 ratio of DNA to TransIT-293 (μg DNA: μl TransIT-293). Supernatants were collected after 48 hours, passed through a 0.2 μm filter, and used to infect CRFK cells. After 24 hours, media containing 8 μg/ ml puromycin was added to select for transduced cells. Cell lines were expanded and grown in puromycin for at least two weeks before expression of TRIM-CypA and TRIM-RanCyp constructs was detected by western blot.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
