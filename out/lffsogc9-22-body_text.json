Other RNA avian viruses with similarly high mutation rates such as avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) illustrate the importance of disease transmission between poultry and wild birds. The emergence and spread of highly pathogenic AI often contribute to its presence in wild birds [28, 29] . In the case of AI, mutation and recombination possibly happened in wild birds and emerged as a highly pathogenic virus in poultry to a devastating effect. Its spread to various continents might also be attributed to migrating waterfowl carrying the virus [29] . Persistent outbreaks, despite a rigorous vaccination effort, such as what has happened in IBV, can be seen in NDV [30] . Studies on both free-living birds and poultry show how NDV has circulated and continued to evolve in the environment [30, 31] . These cases, although they describe other viruses, illustrate the importance of biosecurity and surveillance to prevent possible emerging virulent viruses in the future through the transmission of disease between free-living birds and domestic birds. This is especially important for developing countries where many still practice backyard farming and smallscale farming with low biosecurity [28, 31] , such as those in Indonesia. Unfortunately, interspecies studies of IBV are rarely conducted in the country. This study Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/November-2019/16.pdf is the first to have studied IBV in a species of bird other than chicken in Indonesia.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
