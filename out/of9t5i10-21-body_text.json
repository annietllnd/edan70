Rhinovirus strain 16 (RV16) infection rapidly promotes TLR3-mediated induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and utilizes EGFR signaling to increase IL-8 and ICAM-1 levels. This coupling of antiviral defense machinery (TLR3) and the major epithelial proliferation/ repair pathway may play an important role in viral-induced airway remodeling and airway disease exacerbation [35] and suggests that targeting EGFR may provide a selective therapy that dampens neutrophil-driven inflammation without compromising essential antiviral pathways mediated by PRRs [86] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
