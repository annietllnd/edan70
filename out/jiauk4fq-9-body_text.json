Briefly, twenty-four Friesian calves (8-9 months old), BVDV and BHV-1 antigen and antibody (Ab) free, were housed in the Animal Experimental Center of Cordoba University (Spain). The animals had an adjustment period of one week before the study started and were separated into three groups based on the inoculation protocol: twelve calves were inoculated intranasally with 10 mL of a suspension of non-cytopathic BVDV-1 strain 7443 with a titration of 10 5 tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID 50 )/mL (courtesy of the Institute f√ºr Virologie, TIHO, Hannover, Germany). Twelve days later, when the calves showed neither clinical signs nor BVDV viraemia, they were challenged with 2 mL of BHV-1.1 strain Iowa containing 10 7 TCID 50 /mL (courtesy of the Hipra Laboratories, Girona, Spain) (BVDV/BHV-1 group). Two calves of this group, BHV-1.1-free, were used as BVDV infection controls. At the same time, ten calves were inoculated only with BHV-1.1 (BHV-1 group). Two un-infected (UI) animals were used as negative controls and received intranasally 2 mL of tissue culture fluid free of viruses. The time point of BHV-1.1 inoculation was defined as day 0.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
