Briefly, following cardiac perfusion with 50 mL PBS, leukocytes were isolated from Dounce-homogenized whole brain tissue using a 30% Percoll gradient centrifuged at 7800g ave for 30 min at RT in a Beckman F0630 rotor. The floating myelin layer was removed, and the leukocytes were collected, strained at 40 Î¼m via gravity, diluted in 50 mL PBS, and centrifuged at 600g for 5 min at RT in a Beckman SX4250 rotor. The leukocyte pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS and underlaid with 1 mL of 1.100 g/mL Percoll to enrich for monocytes and neutrophils. With subsequent centrifugation at 800g for 20 min at RT in a Beckman SX4250 rotor without brake, the mononuclear leukocytes were collected at the gradient interface, washed in PBS, and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
