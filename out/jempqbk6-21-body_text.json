Superantigens of the MMTV SAg family cause nonspecific activation of T-cells [51] . The functional characterization of immediate-early protein IE-G from saimiriine herpesvirus indicates that its activity, boosting the T-cell proliferation upon infection [52] , relates it to superantigens of the MMTV SAg family.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
