In wet FIP, significant IL-6 activity has previously been reported in sera and peritoneal exudate cells [9] . The wet, dry, and mixed forms of FIP indicate overlapping disease states with a variable degree of vascular permeability [51, 52] . IL-6 can induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and pulmonary vascular permeability [53] [54] [55] , and the degree of ascites was found to be correlated with serum VEGF levels in cats with FIP [51] . This could explain, via VEGF upregulation, the particularly high hepatic IL-6 transcription levels seen in FIP cats with effusions in our study. Hepatic IL-6 release could also contribute to the progressive plasma cell infiltration seen in older FIP lesions [3, 41] , as IL-6 induces the final maturation of B cells into plasma cells [56] . It might also influence myocardial cytokine transcription, which showed a lower increase in FIP when compared to control cats than the liver samples and might therefore suggest a later, reactive involvement of the myocardium in the disease process. Showing a reactive response might also be the reason that no difference in myocardial transcription was observed between the effusive and non-effusive forms of FIP. However, further investigations into the time course of FIPV infection are needed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
