Search terms consisted of three concepts, i.e. mental disorders, domains of MHL and study regions, linked by a Boolean Operator of "AND". Among each of these concepts, general terms like "mental disorders", "mental health literacy", "China" and individual common phases such as "depression, anxiety, schizophrenia or suicide", "health knowledge, attitudes, practice, helpseeking behaviour" "Chinese people, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau", or their synonyms were used for search. These terms were used in varying combinations to identify relevant literature in different databases (see online Additional file 1 for detailed search strategy and search terms). Since the concept of MHL was introduced and defined by Jorm et al. in the year of 1997 [12] , studies conducted before 1997 were excluded. Searches were carried out between Sep 2017 and Mar 2018 and updated in Nov 2018.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
