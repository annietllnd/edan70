In this case, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway appears to be essential for a step immediately after viral uptake, as inhibition of the cascade leaves virus particle stuck in vesicular compartments, compatible with an arrest of further trafficking within the cell [25] . Recently an early and transient activation of Akt by the enveloped hepatitis C virus (HCV) was also reported, which is most certainly achieved through an interaction between the viral envelope protein E2 and its cellular co-receptors CD81 and claudin-1. This early activation is essential for HCV entry, whereas later in infection Akt activity seems dispensable [26] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
