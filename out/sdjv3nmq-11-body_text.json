As a negative control, conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in JNK was modified to Ala-Pro-Phe (APF), rendering it unable to be phosphorylated. H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-MKK7-JNK1 or pcDNA-FLAG-MKK7-JNK1(APF), before infected with IBV or mock infected. Expression of MKK7-JNK1 was slightly higher than APF, possibly due to differences in protein stability (Fig. 4a) . JNK1 within the fusion protein was efficiently phosphorylated in MKK7-JNK1transfected cells, but not in the APF mutant, as determined by blotting with phos-JNK antibody. Notably, endogenous phos-JNK was promoted in MKK7-JNK1transfeced cells compared to APF control, while endogenous total JNK was not affected. Compared to APF control, transfection of MKK7-JNK1 also increased phosc-Jun in both mock-infected and IBV-infected cells, indicating that MKK7-JNK1 could indeed activate the downstream pathway. PARP cleavage was found significantly higher in cells transfected with MKK7-JNK1, as compared with APF control. Expression of constitutively active JNK did not affect IBV replication, as IBV N level was similar to the APF control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
