To evaluate the relevance of SARS-CoV E, 3a, and 8a viroporins for virulence, BALB/c mice were either subjected to mock infection or infected with parental rSARS-CoV-MA15 or with one of the deletion mutants rSARS-CoV-MA15-Δ3a, -ΔE, and -Δ8a. Clinical disease and survival were monitored through 10 dpi (Fig. 2 ). Mice infected with viruses lacking either E protein or 3a protein recovered from infection with 100% survival, although mice infected with the Δ3a virus showed mild disease symptoms. In contrast, mice infected with the parental virus or the Δ8a virus developed manifestations of serious disease (lethargy and ruffled fur) starting from 2 dpi. These mice all died by 6 dpi, clearly showing that both E and 3a proteins were involved in SARS-CoV virulence in the mouse model, while 8a did not seem to play a major role.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
