Allander suggested a model for HBoV infection in which high viral loads are potentially associated with respiratory symptoms, and low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding [3] . Jacques reported that HBoV at a high viral load could be an etiological agent of respiratory tract disease [4] . The patients positive only for HBoV predominantly constituted the high viral load group, whereas most of the HBoV-positive patients with infection caused by other respiratory viruses belonged to the low viral load group [4] [5] [6] . Martin reported that HBoV positivity did not consistently correspond with the onset of respiratory illness, and its load did not correlate with the severity of illness [7] . Recent results obtained by quantitative realtime PCR suggest that high HBoV viral loads (defined as > 10 6 copies/mL) are frequently present as the sole viral finding for children admitted for RTI [4, 5, 8] . However, the role of HBoV as a causative agent in severe respiratory tract infections (SRTI) is unclear.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
