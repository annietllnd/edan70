It appears that the helix for residues 53-70 does not dimerize, and it may also be structurally independent of Two views of the FLASH NTD forming a coiled-coil dimer with respective protomers colored in green and yellow orange. The hexahistidine-tag was observed in protomer 1. Side chains of residues involved in the dimer interface are shown as sticks, while the other side chains are shown as thin sticks. Colors of atoms: red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen; yellow, sulfur/selenium. (B) Hydrophilic interactions (black dashes) formed by Gln100/Asn101 and Glu107/Asn108 respectively. (C) 2F o -F c electron density for the Cys83 side chains, contoured at 1Ïƒ (blue).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
