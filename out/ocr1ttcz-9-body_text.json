Next, we compared replication kinetics of rVSV, rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E, and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 in cell culture, and found that rVSV-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay in replication kinetics compared to parental rVSV (P < 0.05, Student's ttest) (Supplementary Fig. 2) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
