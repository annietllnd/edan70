As expected, in the absence of SGTA, tetherin fractionated to membranes (Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 5) . However, in the presence of SGTA, the non-glycosylated tetherin species became highly expressed and ~50% fractionated to the cytosol (Fig. 6C, lanes 3 and 6) . These biochemical results support the increased cytosolic localization of tetherin observed in the microscopy analysis and suggest that in the presence of SGTA and Vpu tetherin partially redistributes to the cytosol. Interestingly, in the absence of SGTA, Vpu fractionates to membranes (Fig. 6C, lanes 4 and 5) , but in the presence of SGTA it partially fractionates to the cytosol (Fig. 6C, lane 3) . The integral membrane protein transferrin receptor (TR) was present exclusively in membrane fractions (Fig. 6C) , demonstrating that cytosolic fractions were not contaminated with membrane-associated material. As reported 26 , SGTA was present exclusively in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 6C, lane 3) . We also tested the impact of SGTA overexpression on cytosolic localization of the non-glycosylated tetherin mutant (NN-AA). As shown above, in the presence of SGTA, the WT 23-kDa tetherin species partially fractionates to the cytosol (Fig. 6D, lanes 1 and 2) . Interestingly, although SGTA and Vpu coexpression does not increase the levels of the 23-kDa NN-AA mutant (Figs 3B and 6D) , coexpression of SGTA and Vpu results in a significant increase in the levels of the non-glycosylated mutant in the cytosol (Fig. 6D, lanes 3 and 4) . This further confirms that the cytosolic localization of the non-glycosylated tetherin species is SGTA-dependent.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
