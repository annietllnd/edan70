Previous reports showed that PRRSV proteins, including nsp1, nsp2, nsp11, and N, have been identified and characterized as IFN antagonists [27, 28] . Nsp1 has been considered as multifunctional protein regulating type I IFN responses [29] [30] [31] [32] , and nsp11 and N protein have been described to suppress IFN-Î² induction by antagonizing IRF3 activation [33, 34] . Interestingly, we did not observe upregulation of Interferon Signalling pathway in BOR group, where the expression of N protein encoding gene reached the highest level.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
