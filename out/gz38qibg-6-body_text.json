Initial examination of HCoV-HKU1 S showed that the receptor-binding site on the S1 RBD was occluded when the RBD was in a 'down' conformation and it was hypothesized that conformational changes were required to access this site 16 . Subsequent studies of the highly pathogenic human coronavirus S proteins of SARS-CoV 15, 22 and MERS-CoV 17, 22 showed that these viral S1 RBD do indeed sample an 'up' conformation where the receptor-binding site is accessible. These structural studies also located the positions of the S1/ S2 and S2′ cleavage sites on the prefusion spike. The S1/S2 site lies within a surface exposed loop in the second subdomain of S1 16 . However, the S2′ site lies closer to base of the spike and though this region is located on the surface of the spike, cleavage at this site is prevented by surrounding protein elements 17 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
