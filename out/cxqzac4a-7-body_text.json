The platform uses similar technical features to previous methods, but will be more useful for clinical applications because of its user-friendly analysis software. The EOPM was designed based on the latest versions of nucleic acid sequence resources for microbes. Clinical application of the microarray system confirmed that it can correctly identify the pathogens responsible for infectious disease.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
