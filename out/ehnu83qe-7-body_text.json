Antibodies against CMV qualitatively were detected using BIE, and then, goat antibody against human IgG (anti-IgG) was added to the area with the captured CMV antibody to confirm IgG antibody against CMV. A standard curve representing different concentration gradients was also established for the quantitative detection of CMV antibodies. As such, the concentration of CMV antibody in serum was quantitatively detected by BIE and then compared using ELISAs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
