However, comprehensive mutagenesis studies of individual N-linked glycosylation site knockouts of several viral glycoproteins, and direct biophysical analysis of glycan-protein interactions, have demonstrated their reliance on the host's translational machinery for correct protein folding, and thereby pathogenesis [14, 16, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . For example, the importance of N-linked glycosylation on HIV-1 Env protein folding and stabilization has been investigated thoroughly, including a study that systematically dissected the requirement of each N-linked glycosylation site, which highlighted integral glycans necessary for correct gp160 incorporation into virions [79, 80] . The lack of these glycans seemingly causes misfolding of trimeric Env, preventing efficient secretion and display on the viral surface, highlighting crucial roles for specific N-linked glycans [79] [80] [81] [82] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
