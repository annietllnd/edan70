For example, a community-based survey among the general population in a north-western city of China (Xi'an) found that less than one quarter of individuals with a mental disorder diagnosis had sought mental health services in their lifetime [8, 9] . Structural barriers related to mental health service use include a scarcity of available human and financial resources and disparity in their distribution [10] . Individual factors include widespread stigmatising attitudes, poor recognition of mental disorders, low perceived need for treatment and limited knowledge of available services [8, 11] . These individual factors can be summarised by the concept of 'mental health literacy (MHL)', which has been defined by Jorm et al. as "knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid in recognition, management, or prevention" [12] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
