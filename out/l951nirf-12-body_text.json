The quantification of recombinant baculovirus was carried out from recombinant baculovirus DNA using BacPAK™ qPCR Titration Kit (Takara & Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and quantified PCR copy number per milliliter (/ml) was converted to focus forming units (FFU)/ml by according to manufacturer manual.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
