As a result, 14 is inserted between the solvent-exposed b-strand E2 and the loop formed by Thr-142, Arg-143, and Ala-144 and occupies the S1 and S1 0 sub-pockets of the protein. Other than the reference inhibitor AG-7404 (Fig. 6d) , which is attacked at C-3 (see asterisk), the C-1 carbonyl oxygen of the ethyl amide in 14 is oriented towards the oxyanion hole and forms a hydrogen-bonding network with the backbone amides of Cys-147, Gln-146 and Gly-145. The N-ethyl group points into the S1 0 -pocket. The pyrazolone ring of 14 is sandwiched in the S1 pocket by p Ã€ p interactions with the peptide bonds between Arg-143-Ala-144 on one side and the Gly-164-Asn-165 on the other side. The pyrazol-5-amide NH interacts with Arg-143, Gly-164, and a water molecule that mediates a hydrogen bond to His-161.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
