This analysis was performed including 56 of the 63 patients where reliable information on maintenance immunosuppression was available. In order to exclude selection bias, the comparison was also performed using the subgroup of 8 patients that were proven to be HSV-1 negative by BAL. Albeit not reaching the same level of significance, a similar trend was observed with a similar median immunosuppression severity score of 2.0 in the HSV-1 negative group (data not shown). Though great caution must be applied in interpreting small numbers, it is intriguing that patients with Wegener's Granulomatosis and vasculitis, who had the strongest immunosuppression (score 3.3-3.5) also had a HSV-1 positive BAL more often (15-25% of pneumonia/ pneumonitis) than Rheumatoid arthritis and SLE patients (6-8% of pneumonia/pneumonitis) who were also on a milder immunosuppressive regimen (score 1.5-1.6) ( Table 1 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
