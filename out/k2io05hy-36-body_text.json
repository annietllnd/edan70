The soluble fraction was used in competition assays with DNase I or endoribonucleases belonging to the RNAse III family and in binding assays with dsRNA. In contrast when these proteins were expressed in BL-21 they were totally insoluble and formed inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies fraction was purified using bugbuster reagent, solubilised and used for immunization of rabbits.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
