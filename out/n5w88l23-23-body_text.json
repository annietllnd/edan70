Docking was automatically performed after uploading the coordinates and topology files of the compound and dihydropyrimidinase. The docking models with the highest score in dihydropyrimidinase interacting with dihydromyricetin and myricetin are shown in Fig 5. Although dihydromyricetin and myricetin were docked Inhibition of Dihydropyrimidinase by Flavonoids into the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, their binding modes differed. On one hand, dihydromyricetin interacted with I95, S289, and D316 (Fig 5A) , in which S289 and D316 were found to be crucial for the catalytic activity of dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand, myricetin interacted with N157, Q194, R212, and N337, in which only N337 was crucial. This docking study showed that myricetin only partially occupied the dihydropyrimidinase active site. The ring structure of dihydromyricetin was more flexible than that of myricetin ( Fig 5) because of lacking the double bond on its ring (Fig 3A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
