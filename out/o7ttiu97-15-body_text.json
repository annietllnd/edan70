On average, the SUVMax was higher in the right lung than the left lung but the slopes and Spearman's correlation coefficients (r) were similar between the two sides. The highest correlation was seen between the cumulative bronchiolitis score and SUVMax (r of 0.71 and 0.75 on the right and left, respectively). The next highest was between the cumulative bronchitis score and SUVMax (r of 0.69 on the right and 0.67 on the left). A weaker positive correlation was seen between the cumulative alveolitis score and SUVMax (r of 0.47 on the right and 0.57 on the left).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
