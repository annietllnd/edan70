Two buffers are built up: one that contains the current structure and tests for new secondary structure at the current sequence position and another that tests for pseudoknots on that same structure and sequence. The buffers compete with each other and the minimum free energy is selected from the best result: whether secondary structure or pseudoknot. As a result, the structure that is predicted is the minimum free energy for a given sequence fragment with a given persistence length, temperature and solvent condition.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
