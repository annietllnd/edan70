The further genome pairwise alignments indicated that the genome sequences of the 2 isolates (IP04_2011 and IP06_2012) were 100% identical with each other as well as with the previous HAdV-7 strain 0901HZ/ShX/2009, which was associated with the fatal pneumonia in an ARD outbreak in the Shaanxi Province of China in 2009 7, 15 . The genome sequence identities between both isolates and the other five isolates were extremely high (more than 99.98%). When compared with strain 0901HZ/ShX/2009, the genomes of both isolates OP01_2011 and IP05_2012 contained only one single T insertion in E3 non-coding region and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II, respectively (Table 6 ). Isolate IP01_2010 contained four nucleotide mutations (G to A) in membrane protein E3 RID-alpha, which led to four non-synonymous substitutions in this protein. There was only one synonymous Laboratory data and no. patients tested All HAdV-7 (n = 14)", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
