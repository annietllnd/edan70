Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers among the percutaneous cohort were 15, 60, and 80, for the 10 4 , 10 5 , and 10 6 pfu, respectively. Interestingly, the levels of neutralizing antibody for the percutaneous treatment groups were similar to the subcutaneous group at the same MVA-HA dosage, in spite of slightly higher total H5-specific IgG levels in the subcutaneous cohort (difference is not statistically significant). This set of data suggests that the antibody response, both total IgG and neutralizing antibodies, elicited by MVA-HA was comparable between mice that were inoculated via the subcutaneous route and those inoculated via the percutaneous route. Further, we observed that all mice inoculated with 10 4 pfu of MVA-HA by prime-boost, were protected from influenza virus challenge.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
