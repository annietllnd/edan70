There were two notable characteristics of this outbreak. First, of the total 160 people with a confirmed dengue diagnosis, 129 had visited or worked near Yoyogi Park, a national park that belongs to Shibuya Ward. Shibuya is a special ward that is a major commercial and business center. Shibuya has one of the busiest railway stations in the city, Shibuya Station, about 1 km from the park. Dengue transmission was concentrated in the park, where relatively high vector competence (mean biting rate 7.1 bites per person per 8 minutes) was observed [32] . Second, a few local residents seemed to remain for extended periods in Yoyogi Park (i.e., perhaps homeless people), and these people appeared to have been infected at a higher frequency than other individuals [33] ; however, the role of these individuals in amplifying transmission as primary cases has not been verified. Once the outbreak was recognized in late August 2014, concerted efforts were made to contain spread of the virus, including mosquito control targeting both adults and larvae, disseminating news of the outbreak via mass media, communication of dengue risk by experts to raise public awareness, and even a total ban on entering the park. Descriptive documents with details of the outbreak are available but are mostly limited to Japanese language [26, 28, 30, 33, 34] . However, the effectiveness of interventions during the outbreak remains an important epidemiological question.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
