Fixed costs included barn and housing infrastructure, depreciation of assets, and interest. Variable costs included health-related expenses, mortality, and utilities for electricity and water. Feed represented the largest factor in all management scenarios, followed by labor, then variable and fixed costs. This follows the same results found in previously published models where 57% of total cost were due to feed costs [6] . Using the assumptions in Table 1 , on average, the most expensive management style was the one utilizing group housing, feeding pasteurized whole milk with conventional labor. The least expensive management pathway was the one utilizing individual housing outside, feeding whole milk with conventional labor. The main difference in cost can be attributed to the larger infrastructure needs for group housing and the additional cost of a pasteurizer. Total and daily cost for all management scenarios with 6, 8, 10, and 12 L allotments are shown in Table 3 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
