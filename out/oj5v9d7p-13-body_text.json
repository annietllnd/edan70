Growing evidence indicates that oxidation-reduction (redox)-based regulation of gene expression and adaptive homeostasis are fundamental regulatory mechanisms in cell biology. A great variety of protective systems against oxidative stress in poultry is suggested to be strictly regulated and, depending on the conditions, the stress response can be created over a period of minutes to hours, days to weeks, or months to years [102] . In this respect, signal transduction pathways such as the Nrf2-Keap1 system is one of the fastest responding systems to the changing environment which can upregulate the antioxidant defence network within minutes [102] . Mounting evidence has shown that detrimental alterations in redox signalling in stress conditions could lead to disease development [103] and losses in productive and reproductive poultry performances [15] . However, a low/basal level of oxidative stress is an essential part of cell adaptation and survival due to the creation of adaptive responses with improved adaptive ability to stressful challenges/conditions [104] . Recent findings indicate that in poultry, redox-signalling pathways use ROS as signalling molecules to activate expression of genes responsible for regulation of various physiological functions including growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, as well as to activate vitagenes and increase adaptability to stress [105] . Adaptive homeostasis was presented as a mechanism explaining how variations in stress exposure (type, duration, intensity/strength, etc.), including oxidative stress, are dealt with by a cooperative action of various protective mechanisms [102] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
