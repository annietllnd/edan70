These cells play a crucial role in immune surveillance, pathogen killing and adaptive immune response stimulation [11] . PRRSV impairs macrophage phagocytic and bactericidal functions, induces host cell death often resulting in an inflammatory response, and perhaps most importantly predisposes the pig to secondary infections [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, opportunistic pathogens, whether viral-swine influenza virus, pseudorabies virus-or bacterial-Streptococcus suis, Bordetella brochiseptica-potentiate PRRSV-induced pneumonia [14] . These synergistic effects promote a self-sustaining inflammatory response increasing the severity and the duration of the disease [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
