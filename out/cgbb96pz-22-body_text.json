A, B) CRFK cell lines transduced to stably express the indicated TRIM-RanCyp (as indicated at the top of each graph) were infected with viruses encoding the indicated cyclophilin-binding loop (X-axis) in the HIV-1 backbone, and a GFP reporter. The percentage of cells infected in each sample was normalized to an empty vector control. Infections were performed in triplicate and error bars represent twice the standard error of the mean.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
