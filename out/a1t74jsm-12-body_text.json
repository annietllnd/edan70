Our broad-range PCR primers are capable of detecting and distinguishing a wide range of Borrelia species including B. americana, B. bissettii, and B. californiensis previously detected in I. pacificus ticks [42] [43] [44] . Only B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi were observed in this study. As the study was performed over the course of several years, we were able to improve the throughput of the assay by reducing the number of primers used from 16 to 8 without affecting sensitivity or breadth of coverage for tick-borne pathogens. This is the first observation of the protozoan parasite Babesia odocoilei in I. pacificus ticks. We detected this organism in 3.0% of the ticks tested from areas ranging from Humboldt County in the far northern part of California to San Bernardino County in Southern California, indicating that this pathogen is probably widespread among its known Cervidae and Bovidae hosts [45] in the state. B. odocoilei is known to be widely distributed in I. scapularis ticks throughout the eastern United States [45, 46] , where it is has been reported from as far north as Saskatchewan, Canada [47] to as far south as Tennessee [48] and is not known to cause human illness.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
