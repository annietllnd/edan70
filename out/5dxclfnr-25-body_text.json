Later a Nef-mediated activation of PI3K, which resulted in the inhibitory phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic factor BAD blocking premature apoptosis in T-cells, was observed. Although the decline of T-cells is characteristic of progressive HIV infection, this early delay may ensure cellular survival until viral particles are assembled and released from the cell [55] . The authors suggest that these conflicting observations could be the result of a different cellular localization of Nef during the experiments. Graziani and colleagues used a stable cell line expressing Nef mostly in the cytoplasm and not directly at the plasma membrane [54] , at which Wolf and coworkers showed the protein to be necessary for the activation of PI3K signaling [55] . Although ectopic expression of viral genes might be a useful, and sometimes indispensable tool to unravel protein interactions, there is also an inherent risk of missing out on the temporal and spatial aspects of kinase activation during viral replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
