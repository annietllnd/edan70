Decoding of the underlying nucleotide sequence is sometimes problematic, as, for instance, isoleucine and leucine have the same exact mass. In some cases, the identified peptides do not match the database for various reasons, including errors in gene/protein annotation and post-translational modifications in the peptides that are not accounted for. Usually, unmatched peptides are not reported in publications and are disregarded from further analysis. It is possible that some of these unmatched peptides correspond to an alternative reading frame. In order to match these peptides, one would need to generate a database derived from the +1/âˆ’1 frames of the ORFeome, similar to what Okamura et al. have done (Okamura et al., 2006) , and make these accessible to the proteomic community. One problem is the "breakpoint" of frameshifting, which would generate a peptide that is partially composed of the original frame and partially of the frameshifted peptide (see Figure 4) . Another problem in this approach may be the paucity of frameshifted peptides, as they are commonly expressed at lower levels (see above) and may not be easily detectable by MS approaches. However, MS is probably the most powerful method to identify out-of-frame peptides to confirm endogenous expression.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
