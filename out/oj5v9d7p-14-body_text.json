Hence, several important gene-coding proteins that regulate the complex network of the so-called longevity assurance processes were suggested to be called "vitagenes" [106] . Later, the vitagene concept was further developed in relation to the medical sciences by Calabrese and colleagues [107] [108] [109] [110] . The major pro-survival mechanisms in the body/cells which are under vitagene network control are shown in Table 2 . As can be seem from Table 2 , the vitagene network operates on four levels. At the molecular level, it is related to antioxidant defence systems, including a DNA-repairing system, synthesis of stress proteins and proteasomal degradation of damaged proteins. Indeed, cellular proteostasis is a key element of homeostasis maintenance. Safety of genetic information transfer is also regulated at this level. At the cellular level, the aforementioned processes regulated at the vitagene level are related to cell proliferation and differentiation, and cell membrane integrity. Stability of intracellular milieu and macromolecular turnover are also connected to the vitagene network. At the tissue and organ level, the vitagene network is responsible for neutralization and removal of toxic chemicals, tissue regeneration, cell death and replacement. Therefore, the aforementioned events are vital elements of tissue/organ homeostasis maintenance. Finally, at the physiological level, the vitagene network is responsible for stress response, adaptation and thermoregulation. Furthermore, hormonal, immune and neuronal response to environmental/nutritional factors are also regulated by the vitagene response.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
