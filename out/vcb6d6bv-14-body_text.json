It adopts in its closed configuration an hourglass shape with a "plug" in the narrowest point to maintain the permeability barrier of the membrane. The translocation/insertion process starts with the interaction between the translocon and its cytosolic counterpart (the ribosome in the case of the co-translational insertion pathway). This interaction triggers conformational changes in the translocon to accommodate the incoming polypeptide; a lateral 'crack' appears in the cytosolic side while the hourglass middle constriction increases its diameter [42] [43] [44] . As the polypeptide enters the channel additional structural modifications occur. First, the plug is displaced. Next, the lateral crack expands across the entire channel creating a lateral gate facing the core of the membrane [45] . At this stage the protein sequence within the translocon will, depending on its characteristics, laterally partition into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (in the case of TM segments) [33] or, if the polypeptide region is not hydrophobic enough, continue through the channel to be translocated into the ER lumen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
