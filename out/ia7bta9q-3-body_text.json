The flavivirus MTase is believed to catalyze both the N7 and 29-O methylation steps, and may also act as a guanylyltransferase (GTase) to form the G59-ppp-59A linkage [5, 6] , thereby playing key roles in the capping process. In 2007, the crystal structures of the RdRP region (the C-terminal 630 residues) from WNV and DENV were reported [7, 8] . Despite the fact that polymerase motifs F and G were not resolved, these RdRP structures exhibit high degree of similarity to the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) that represent the other two genera of the family Flaviviridae [9, 10] . Different from primer-dependent RdRPs such as poliovirus (PV) 3D [11, 12] , these polymerases contain a ''priming element'' that partially occupies the putative ds-RNA channel (also termed ''front channel'') and is believed to play an important role in de novo initiation of the RNA synthesis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
