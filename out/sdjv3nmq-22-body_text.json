However, our data showed that SP600125 above 10 µM inhibited IBV replication in a dosage-dependent manner. In fact, SP600125 inhibits replication of poxviruses 32 and VSV 33 , and nonspecifically inhibits entry of HCV 34 . With the antiviral activity of SP600125 for coronavirus remaining uncharacterized, cautions should be taken to interpret these inhibitor studies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
