Upon incoming survival signals, the Akt-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAD prevents the induction of the caspase cascade. In addition, the inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1 by Akt blocks its translocation into the nucleus and thus prevents the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. A variety of viral proteins steps into this regulatory network to assure cell survival, and thus maintaining the cellular environment for viral replication. Known viral proteins interacting with the cellular member of the signaling pathways are highlighted in red.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
