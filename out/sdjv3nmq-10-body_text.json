Nonetheless, phos-JNK showed a similar pattern as in H1299 cells: only wild-type MKK7 and 3E, but not KM or 3A, significantly enhanced IBV-induced JNK phosphorylation compared with vector control (Fig. 3b) . PARP cleavage pattern also correlated with JNK activation, same as in H1299 cells. As IBV N was detected at slightly different levels in the transfected cells, plaque assay was performed to titrate IBV in the supernatants of infected cells. As shown in Fig. 3c , similar IBV titers were detected in all transfected samples, suggesting that transfection of MKK7 or mutants did not affect IBV replication in Huh-7 cells. Therefore, both ATP binding and phosphorylation sites were required for MKK7 to activate JNK during IBV infection. Moreover, MKK7-dependent JNK phosphorylation promoted IBV-induced apoptosis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
