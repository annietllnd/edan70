Three different samples (0.10-0.12 ml) were loaded into the sample channels of six-channel epon charcoal-filled centerpieces, and 0.11-0.13 ml buffers were loaded into the reference channels. The cells were then loaded into the rotor and run at speed of 10,000, 15,000, and 25,000 rpm each for 12 h at 20ËšC. Ten A 280 nm scans with time interval of 8-10 min were measured for every different rotor speed to check the status of sedimentation equilibrium. Global analyses of combined sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity data were conducted with SEDPHAT using species analysis model [55] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
