Quite generally, the distribution of the size of an epidemic initiated by an infected arrival is bimodal, with distinct peaks corresponding to a major epidemic and a minor outbreak ( Figure 1E ). In the latter event the outbreak simply fades out by chance despite there being ample susceptibles in the population for ongoing trans- In (B), the step illustrates the probabilistic removal of travelers who have completed their incubation period.

Screening sensitivity for this illustration is 60% on both departure and arrival.
