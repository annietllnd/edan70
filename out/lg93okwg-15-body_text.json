The first mutated cluster is located closer to the N-terminal end, while the second cluster is located near the middle of the NTD. In addition, since Lys129 and Asp130 form an ion pair in the dimer interface, we also replaced these two charged residues as well as the preceding Arg128 with alanines, generating the R128A/K129A/D130A mutant. Our gel filtration results showed that the Y73A/L76A/Y80A mutant had essentially the same migration behavior as the C54S/C83A control, while the N101A/L104A/N108A and R128A/K129A/ D130A mutants actually migrated faster ( Fig 4B) . As a control, we made the K88A/K92A/ K95A mutant, changing three residues located outside of the dimer interface. As expected, the migration behavior of this mutant was nearly the same as that for the C54S/C83A protein ( Fig  4B) . Our analytical ultracentrifugation studies on the N101A/L104A/N108A mutant suggested that it might be trimeric in solution ( Table 2 , see below), suggesting that the mutation has perturbed the structure of the NTD. Therefore, the N101A/L104A/N108A and R128A/K129A/ D130A mutants will not be described further.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
