The Kan-r PCR fragment and RP DNA along with RP RNA PCR fragment were used as reaction control and sample control respectively. If control bands were absent, the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors. Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
