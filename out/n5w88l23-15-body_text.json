The amplified gene was then ligated into the pET21b vector for protein expression. P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase was hetero-overexpressed in E. coli and purified from the soluble supernatant using Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography. Pure protein was obtained in this single chromatographic step with an elution of buffer A. Approximately 50 mg of purified protein was extracted from 1 L of a culture of E. coli cells. The mutant dihydropyrimidinases were also purified according to the same protocol used for the wild-type proteins, and yielded very similar purification results.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
