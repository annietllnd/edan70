Moreover, to limit the impact of tulathromycin and PRRSV-induced apoptosis on macrophage numbers and functions, we treated our cells with tulathromycin at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and decreased PRRSV m.o.i from 0.5 to 0.1. At these concentrations, neither the virus nor the drugs significantly induced MDM apoptosis at the experimental time points (data not shown). If the cells were treated at a concentration of 1mg/mL, functional analysis were performed before 12 hours of incubation. PRRSV infection induced a sharp fibroblast-like morphological alteration and pseudopod projections in MDMs (Fig 3A) . In uninfected cells (control and TUL), less than 20% of cells exhibited this change in morphology, while nearly 60% of the cells exhibited this phenotype upon PRRSV infection (Fig 3B) . Tulathromycin pre-treatment significantly inhibited this morphological change in MDMs (Fig 3B) . Since macrophage shape and function are correlated [41] , we hypothesized that PRRSV-induced morphological changes were associated with a change in macrophage activation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
