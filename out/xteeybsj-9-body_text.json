SIV is widespread in swine worldwide, and many countries have described virus circulation and antibody prevalence in pig populations. In Brazil, few studies have shown the presence of influenza virus in the swine population. 10, 11, [13] [14] [15] However, the anti-influenza antibody prevalence after the H1N1 pandemic and the susceptibility of pigs in farrow-to-finish farms has not been extensively studied in the country. The detection of anti-influenza antibodies in most of the farms suggests virus circulation, once Brazil had no approved vaccination program against influenza while this experiment was being performed. Virus circulation is also suggested in this study because of the variation of antibody titers between the farms and across the sampled categories, which may be caused by seroconversion at some farms.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
