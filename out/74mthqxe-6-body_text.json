Here we examined if IFITM proteins also restrict entry of JSRV, whose Env-mediated membrane fusion readily occurs at pH 6.3 or even higher [27, 33] . We did so by creating several stable lines expressing human IFITM1, 2 or 3 and testing their effects on JSRV entry, along with that of several other viruses. We observed that all three IFITM proteins effectively inhibited the infections of MoMLV pseudovirions bearing either IAV HA/NA or VSV-G in HTX cells (a subclone of the HT1080 cell line), with approximately equivalent efficiency ( Fig. 1A ; p,0.01). Interestingly, the JSRV pseudovirion infection in HTX cells was inhibited by IFITM1 (p,0.01) to a much greater extent than by IFITM2 and 3 (p,0.01 and p,0.05, respectively) ( Fig. 1A ). IFITM1 also moderately, but consistently, inhibited the infection by amphotropic 10A1 MLV pseudovirions (p,0.05), yet IFITM2 and 3 did not inhibit and even somewhat enhanced entry (Fig. 1A) . Similar results were also obtained in 293 cells, where IFITM1 caused the greatest restriction of JSRV entry (p,0.01), although the overall restriction efficiency of these IFITM proteins on VSV and IAV entry was relatively low (Fig. 1B) , consistent with a previous report [13] . Immunoblotting revealed that all three IFITM proteins were expressed in both HTX and 293 cells (Figs. 1C and D), with IFITM3 exhibiting a relatively low level of expression in HTX cells (Fig. 1C) , which might have contributed to its relatively low antiviral activities in this cell line.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
