Diagnosis of ON was blindly made by two pathologists based on the characteristic histopathological features with diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow necrosis [16] . All rabbits that had at least one ON lesion in the examined areas were considered to be ON + , while those without ON lesion were considered to be ON -. The ON + rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
