After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were lysed in 1× RIPA buffer. After clarifying by centrifugation and determination of protein concentration by spectrophotometer, the cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol 51 . The protein samples were boiled at 90°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Equal amount of protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After the nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mMNaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with 1 µg/ml primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing with Trisbuffered saline, the membranes were incubated with 1:2000 diluted anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were washed and the proteins detected with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and medical X-ray films (Fujifilm) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The films were scanned as gray scale 8-bit images and the density of bands were determined by the NIH software ImageJ. All experiments were repeated for at least three times with similar result, and one of the representative results is shown.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
