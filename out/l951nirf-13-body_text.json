Seventy-two hours after infection, western blotting was carried out using a mouse anti-pH1N1 primary antibody (1:100 dilution; raised in our laboratory from survived mice against ma-pH1N1 challenge). An anti-Î²-actin antibody (1:2,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as a protein loading control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
