Either both virus classes are represented by a large number of proteins, and the evolutionary relationships between the viral proteins (and their cellular relatives, that are present in the family) are ancient and difficult to resolve; or one of the two or both groups of proteins are present only in a few genera, often one group being underrepresented relative to the other. In the latter case, HGT can often be proposed. When comparing protein sequences, we call the first pattern "balanced sequence distribution" and the second pattern "unbalanced sequence distribution". Since the sequence homology is in all cases evident, we can be sure that we deal with a monophyletic protein family and, hence, use phylogenetic analysis and discuss the evolutionary events that happened in that family. In the comparison of protein structures, we set the algorithm parameters such that we discover proteins that have the same fold according to the CATH [76] classification or the same fold in SCOP [77] . The common ancestry of such proteins is likely, but not necessary, so we refrain from calling these grouping protein families. Instead, we use terms "widely represented folds" and "confined fold" for the two patterns mentioned above. It must be noted that beside proteins with homologs in cellular species, all other families with balanced sequence distributions and widely represented folds correspond to viral hallmark genes. For families with unbalanced sequence distribution and confined folds, we can propose a scenario involving horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in most cases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
