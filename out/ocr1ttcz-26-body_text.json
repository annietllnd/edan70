Western blot showed that the NS1 expression in rVSV-G1670A-NS1-infected cells was significantly higher than pCI-NS1-transfected cells (Fig. 6d) . A pilot experiment showed that rVSV-G1670A-NS1 still caused considerable weight losses in A129 mice. Thus, we decided to test the protection efficacy of rVSV-G1670A-NS1 in BALB/c mice.
