The capsids of LSV1 and 2 have significant profile similarity to the capsid gene of Nudaurelia capensis beta-tetravirus by HHpred [63] (evalue 1.0610 226 ) and they exhibit weak direct protein alignment by Blastx (e-value 1.0610 204 ). Similarity to tetravirus capsid genes consistently outranked similarity to CBPV or nodavirus capsids by these methods. Tetraviruses are not close relatives of the Nodavirales superfamily, although Betatetraviruses have a similar monopartite genome organization to LSV ( Figure 5B ). LSV1 and 2 share 70% amino acid identity over the capsid. The LSV1 capsid overlaps the RdRp gene in the +1 reading frame for 125 nt before ending in a pair of stop codons (separated by two residues). The LSV2 capsid is in frame with the RdRp and separated by 18 nt without a redundant stop codon.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
