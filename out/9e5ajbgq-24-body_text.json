We identified individual factors, encompassing three major risk domains (children oral health behavior and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary habits) that were predominantly associated with dental caries' experience in our study. Especially, child oral health behavior and practices, such as brushing teeth at least once daily, starting the practice of brushing earlier than 2 years, and visiting a dentist regularly, were significantly associated with dental caries. In addition, children mixed-fed with both breast milk and powdered milk, children sleeping with bottle in mouth, and the practice of snacking two or more items between meals were linked to dental caries experience in children. Dietary habits, such as less frequent consumption of fresh fruits (once a week or less) and more frequent consumption of soft drinks and flavored milk (more than once a week), were significantly associated with dental caries in our study. In our sample, socioeconomic factors (less-educated mothers, low family income, and lack of dental insurance coverage) were less influential than individual factors in determining dental caries' experience in 6-8-year-old male primary school children.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
