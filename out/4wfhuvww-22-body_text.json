The database utilizes information from âˆ¼1500 known frameshifted gene products. A majority of the data on frameshifting comes from two frameshifted proteins, RF2 and antizyme, and is constantly updated using the respective prediction tools [ARFA (Bekaert et al., 2006) and OAF (Bekaert et al., 2008) , respectively]. PseudoViewer is used for visualization of pseudoknot structures. (http://recode.ucc.ie)", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
