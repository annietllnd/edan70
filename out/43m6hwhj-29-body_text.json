On the other hand, Integrin Signaling pathway was strongly associated with down-regulated genes in ILI group. Integrins are cell surface glycoproteins involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, inducing signalling across the cell membrane to regulate cell proliferation, activation, migration and homeostasis [60] . In a recent study, integrins were shown to be involved in sensing of PRRSV infected macrophages by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which stimulated production of INF-Î± [61] . Such mechanism seems to allow the host counteract PRRSV strategies aiming the suppression of type I INF induction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
