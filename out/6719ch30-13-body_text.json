All antibodies were added to blocked wells at 1:200, incubated for 30 min, and washed three times prior to flow cytometric analysis. Brain-infiltrating cells were gated on CD45 expression. All CD45 mid/hi cells were further assessed for expression of CD11b, Ly-6C/G (Gr1), and Ly-6G (1A8). We defined inflammatory monocytes as the CD45 hi CD11b + Gr1 ++ 1A8 − population, neutrophils as CD45 hi CD11b ++ Gr1 + 1A8 + cells, and microglia as CD45 mid CD11b mid Gr1 − cells. For phenotyping experiments involving reporter LysM:eGFP mice, we defined inflammatory monocytes as GFP mid cells, neutrophils as GFP hi cells, and microglia as GFP neg cells within a specific forward-and side-scatter gate. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer with sampler arm (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Files were analyzed offline using FlowJo 10.08 (Windows version; FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
