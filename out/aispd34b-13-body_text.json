[18] , although some have since been redesigned (Table 1) . Table 1 also contains primers designed to target new var genes identified in the P. falciparum genome database [32] and primers for additional genes used as controls (msp1 -PFI1475w and seryl-tRNA synthetase -PF07_0073). All primers were initially tested on genomic DNA to determine the 'amplification efficiency' compared to the amplification of the internal control, seryl-tRNA synthetase.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
