Although the sA protein localises mainly in viral factories in the cytoplasm of infected cells, it also localizes in the nucleoli [66] . sA has a strong affinity for dsRNA and it may provide protection against the IFNinduced and dsRNA dependent PKR response. Interestingly, sA mutants that do not bind dsRNA are also unable to reach the nucleoli, suggesting that dsRNA binding and nucleolar targeting may be strictly linked [69] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
