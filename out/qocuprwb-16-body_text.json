Brains were dissected to provide four separate fractions, ie the brain cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem. Until they were used, these tissues were stored at -80Â° C. Each tissue was homogenized in ten volumes of PBS containing 10% FCS and diluted with EMEM with 2% FCS. Virus titers were determined by plaque forming assays using BHK cells and were expressed as pfu/g tissue [48] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
