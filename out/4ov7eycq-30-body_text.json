Briefly, the PNY200 yeast strain 60 was co-transformed with linear pGBT.superB DNA 61 and bait fragment to obtain recombinant plasmid to express Vpu fused to the GAL4 DNA binding protein (BD). The BK100 yeast strain 60 was transformed with a prey cDNA library (isolated from brain, spleen, and macrophages), which expresses the various cDNA-encoded proteins as hybrids with the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (AD). To perform the yeast two-hybrid screen, the PNY200 yeast strain expressing the GAL4-binding domain fusions was mated with the BK100 yeast strain. After mating, the cells are plated onto selective media, and if the bait and prey proteins interacted, transcription of two auxotrophic reporter genes (HIS3 and ADE2) with dissimilar promoters occurred 62 and colonies were picked from the selection plates, and the prey inserts were identified by sequence analysis. To confirm interactions in this screen, the bait and prey plasmids were isolated from yeast diploids, and co-transformed into a native yeast strain, and a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system 62 was used to monitor the interaction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
