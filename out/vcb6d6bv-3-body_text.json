Therefore, viroporins must, first, reach and insert into the membrane and, second, interact with themselves to form higher ordered structures that will eventually be the functional units. This two-stage process resembles the original two-stage model proposed in 1990 by Engelman and Poppot for α-helical membrane protein folding [9] . In their original model the authors propose that folding of many integral α-helical membrane proteins can be envisioned in two subsequent stages. In the first stage, hydrophobic alpha-helices would be established across the lipid bilayer; and in a second stage, the already inserted helices would interact with each other to form higher order functional transmembrane (TM) structures.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
