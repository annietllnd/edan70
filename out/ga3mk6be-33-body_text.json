In order to discern between these two possibilities, N in position 6) in order to render this protein identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein ( Figure 8B ). Both cytopathic protection assays and multistep growth assays clearly showed that BTV-8/1S9 replicated more efficiently than BTV-8/ 1S9DNS4 in the presence of IFN ( Figure 8C, D) . Similar results were obtained with BTV-8/1NS4, which replicated more efficiently than BTV-8DNS4 in cells pre-treated with IFN, while no major differences were observed between BTV-1/8S9 and BTV-1/8S9DNS4. Collectively, these data strongly indicate that the NS4 of BTV-1 is not defective and can function within the context of BTV-8.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
