{"cord_uid":"yy77veid", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC6817825", "divid":2, "text":"Throughout, it would be helpful for the figures to append "RNP" with the identity (Cas9 or Cas12a) so it is straightforward to determine which enzyme is being used in each experiment. For example, the data in Figure 2 results from the use of two different enzymes, but this is too easy to overlook. In Figure 5 , referring to the peptide as simply "shuttle" is counter-productive and confusing, especially since other figures use the term "peptide". I propose the text "shuttle" in the figure be replaced with "CM18-PTD4 peptide". An analogous improvement could be made to Supplemental Figure 4 (specify the peptide identity in the figure itself). Generally, the reader should be able to know which cargo and which peptide is being specified. In this sense Figure 4 (Cas9 delivered via S10) is an improvement over Figure 6 (Cas12a can be inferred if the reader really tries; no mention of the peptide).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
