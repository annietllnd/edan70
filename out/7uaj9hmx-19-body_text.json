After plating, adherent monocytes exhibited a round shape morphology and were approximatively 10Î¼m in diameter ( Fig 1A) . By day 7, the cells displayed a larger, macrophage-like, morphology with characterisitic cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig 1C) . Monocyte differentiation was also measured using non-specific esterase (NSE) staining. By day 7 more than 95% cells were esterase-positive cells. Oneday-old monocytes were significantly less susceptible to PRRSV compared to 7 days old differentiated MDMs (Fig 2) . PRRSV viral particle numbers increased by a 1.69 log (50-fold increase) in MDMs, and by a 1.1 log (13-fold increase) in blood monocytes, between 2 and 48 hours p.i. In both cell types, PRRSV infection reached a plateau at 24h p.i. (Fig 2) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
