All challenged mice lost weight rapidly during the initial 5 days post infection (dpi), with the exception of mice in the PBS group, subsequently regained lost weight. Mice immunized with AcHERV-VLP lost~10% of their initial weight, whereas mice in the AcHERV-HA group showed about a 15% weight loss. Furthermore, mice were monitored the entering of recovery phage, AcHERV-VLP began recovery on 7 dpi, whereas recovery was delayed (11 dpi) in the AcHERV-HA group (Fig 5A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
