Following JaOArS982 virus infection, TNF-α KO mice exhibited significantly increased mortality rates when compared with WT mice. Although it has been suggested that TNF-/-mice show developmental defects of the humoral immune system 10 4 pfu of JaTH160 at 9 days pi. JEV antigens were detected using E-protein specific JEV antibody (insets). Each experiment represents four, five and six mice of WT, TNF-α KO and IL-10 KO mice, respectively. The B6 WT and IL-10 KO mice showed severe inflammatory reactions in the brain cortex. On other hand, the TNF-a KO mice exhibited acute necrotic changes with slight inflammatory reactions in the brain cortex.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
