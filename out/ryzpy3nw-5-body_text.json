Previous studies reviewed by Sparkes [8] have examined the protection of cats against infection afforded by vaccination with a variety of commercial vaccines, which were shown to vary considerably in efficacy. Another study examined the protection of cats against FeLV challenge following vaccination with Leukocellâ„¢ 2 and showed duration of immunity lasting at least 12 months following the primary course [7] . Here we present data from three separate clinical studies examining protection against FeLV-related disease at 8, 20 and 36 months after the primary vaccination regimen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
