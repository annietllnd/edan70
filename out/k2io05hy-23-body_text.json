At 48 hours post-transfection, the cells were dissolved in sample denaturation buffer as described above. Cell lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot, using an immune serum (diluted 1/50, in 5% skimmed milk) from mice infected with BTV-8. Non-transfected cells were used as control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
