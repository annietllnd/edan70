This RNA was subjected to a one step Real-Time Reverse Transcription plus Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) using primers and Taqman probes (at the same concentration) from conserved regions of the 5'-UTR of BVDV-1a [41] . The reaction was performed using the Real Time Ready RNA Virus Master (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in a LightCycler 1.5, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples with a cycle threshold value less than or equal to 45 were considered as positive. The positive control was the NCP BVDV-1 strain 7443 at 10 5 TCID 50 /mL. A real-time PCR analysis of the BHV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), extracted from lung samples using Genomic DNA from a tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), was performed according to the OIE Terrestrial Manual [42] . After analyzing the results on an Applied 7300 detector (Applied Biosystems, USA), any sample with a cycle threshold value less than or equal to 45 was considered as positive. The positive control was the BHV-1.1 strain Iowa at 10 8.3 TCID 50 /mL.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
