As in prior studies, U. parvum was more common than U. urealyticum, [10, 11, 15, 17] with 41% of the genitourinary specimens testing positive for the former and 12% for the latter. In one prior study, 63% of specimens were positive for U. parvum and 7% for U. urealyticum [15] . Another study showed, using a multiplex PCR-reverse line blot assay, that 48% of first voided urine specimens from women attending sexual health clinics in Australia were positive for U. parvum and 25% for U. urealyticum [17] . In the study by Tang et al., 36% of genitourinary swabs collected from hospitalized males and females in China were positive for U. parvum and 8% for U. urealyticum [10] . Finally, in study by Vancutsem et al., 44% of lower genital tract specimens obtained from healthy women at their first prenatal visit in Belgium were positive for U. parvum and 10% for U. urealyticum [11] . Despite different geographic locales and clinical status, these numbers are strikingly similar.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
