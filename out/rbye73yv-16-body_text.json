However, as different animal models were established among labs worldwide with slightly different evaluation end points, it is difficult to make a direct comparison among these mAbs. This is also true for in vitro evaluation of neutralizing activitiessince different cell lines, pseudoviruses, and neutralizing assay techniques are utilized, the published IC 50 values can only serve as indirect reference for comparison. Head to head comparison in the same experimental system would be required to identify the most protective mAb or combination of mAbs against MERS-CoV infection in order to proceed to clinical trials.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
