We found that IBV-induced phosphorylation of MKK7, JNK, and c-Jun in the infected cells. Transfection of MKK7, but not MKK4, promoted IBV-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Using various MKK7 mutants, we showed that both ATP-binding activity and phosphorylation sites in MKK7 were required for optimal JNK activation in IBV-infected cells. Finally, gain-offunction and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that JNK phosphorylation plays a pro-apoptotic role during IBV infection. Thus, this study established a crucial involvement of JNK in regulating apoptosis induced by coronavirus infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
