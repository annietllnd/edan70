Several enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms have been proposed that result in an enhancement of frameshifting. For instance, the production of antizyme by +1 frameshifting is enhanced by the end-products of ODC-spermine, putrescine, and spermidine (Ivanov et al., 2000a) . How polyamines regulate +1 frameshifting is not well understood, but one hypothesis is that polyamine binding to RNA may enable read-through of the termination codon. Similar to polyamines, amino-glycosides such as gentamicin allow read-through of stop-codons (Martin et al., 1989; Malik et al., 2010) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
