After pretreatment of MHV receptor-expressing HAP1, H1-DV33, and H1-DV33-fV33A cells with furin inhibitor (FI) or mock treatment, cells were inoculated with MHV-EFLM or mutant virus MHV-S29FCS in presence or absence of FI. At 7 hpi the cells were lysed and viral-replication dependent luciferase expression levels were determined. In agreement with previous results (Fig. 5) , infection with MHV carrying a wild type S was severely reduced in cells lacking a functional HOPS complex and addition of the FI did not alter this effect (Figure 8, red bars) . In contrast, infection with MHV-S29FCS was not decreased by the lack of a functional HOPS complex. However, FI treatment had a clearly negative effect on this virus, which was much more dramatic in the absence of a functional HOPS complex in H1-DV33 cells (Figure 8 , blue). In conclusion, MHV-S29FCS lost the requirement for a functional HOPS complex in parallel with this virus becoming insensitive to the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI. In contrast to the virus with the wild type S, the mutant virus became sensitive to inhibition of furin cleavage.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
