The pellet of enteroids was incubated in 0.25% Trypsin (Gibco) for 5 min at 37 • C and dissociated by repeated pipetting to obtain a single-cell suspension. DMEM-F12 with 10% (v/v) FBS was added into the single-cell suspension, and the mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium at RT and seeded at 50 enteroids per well in a Matrigel-precoated 96-well plate. After differentiation for about 3-4 days, planar monolayers of 2D enteroids were ready for use in experiments.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
