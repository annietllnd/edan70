To examine any potential conformational differences in SARS-CoV S 2P compared to unstabilized wild-type S ectodomains 15, 22 , we determined structures of the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain. This included a 3.2 Å resolution C3-symmetric reconstruction and several asymmetric reconstructions (3.9-4.5 Å, see below) ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S4 and Figs S1, S2). The S1 NTD and some of the S1 RBD, while clearly present, appear poorly resolved in the cryo-EM maps, precluding a de novo build of these regions. For this reason, available SARS-CoV S crystal structures 22,23 of corresponding domains were placed into these densities. Overall, the SARS-CoV S 2P structure resembles that of other coronaviruses, particularly those of the betacoronavirus genus 16, 17, 19, 22 and the previously published SARS-CoV wild-type prefusion ectodomains 15, 22 . The S1 domains surround the helical S2 subunits and interdigitate at the 22 (5X58.pdb, dark green) and the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain (6CRV.pdb light green) adopt identical conformations near the 2P mutation site. Coordinate models derived from C3 symmetry cryo-EM reconstructions are shown. (c) There is highly featured density in the region containing the 2P mutation site. (d) Classification of heterogeneity within the S1 RBD reveals a distribution of RBD configurations with the single-'up' conformation being most prevalent. S1 regions are shown in blue and S2 regions are shown in green. membrane-distal apex of the trimeric spike. The structure of the S2 subunit appears to be highly conserved across coronavirus genera 18, 20, 21 . The SARS-CoV prefusion wild-type and 2P structures are nearly identical in most regions, including regions proximal to the 2P mutation site (Fig. 1b,c) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
