The success of this pathway may explain its use by a multitude of viruses. Importantly, the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane not only seems to be a suitable instance for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for already triggering a desired cellular surrounding; rather it seems that the pathway is directly involved in the entry of various viruses by facilitating endocytotic uptake. This is the case for the enveloped influenza A virus, whose binding to its sialic acid receptor results in the clustering of plasma membrane lipid rafts [17] (Figure 2 ). These are small domains within the plasma membrane enriched for cholesterols and glycosphingolipids [18] . As they contain different sets of proteins-mainly signaling molecules-lipid rafts are thought to be involved in signal transduction (for review see [19] ). The clustering of such lipid rafts after influenza A attachment subsequently leads to the activation of at least two RTKs followed by signaling events through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promote viral internalization [20] , supported by the cross-interaction of PI3K with the Ras signaling pathway [21] . Moreover, acidification of the endosomal interior, necessary for fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes is in part controlled by ERK and PI3K by upregulating the vacuolar H + -ATPase activity. Based on immunoprecipitation experiments using extracts from the epithelial cell lines MDCK and A549, direct interactions between the phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2 and the PI3K p85Î± subunit with the E subunit of this proton pump have been shown [22] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
