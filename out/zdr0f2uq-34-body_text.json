One important consideration is understanding the potentially varied roles and efficiencies of glycan shields in the context of immune evasion. Regardless of these potential differences, the widespread use of glycosylation as a tactic to thwart the response of the humoral-immune system underscores the vulnerability of protein epitopes to immune pressure. Some of these viruses such as HIV-1, Influenza, and Lassa appear to be "evasion strong" pathogens [166] that utilise varied mechanisms to change how immunogenic epitopes are presented on their respective envelope proteins. However, shielding of the protein surface of the viral glycoprotein with glycans is not fool-proof, and can lead to the evolution of anti-glycan antibodies and recognition by the host immune response; both innate and humoral.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
