Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in dark. Cells were washed twice and stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI in 0.1% PBS-T for 5 min at 37 • C in dark. Then, the stained cells were mounted on slides for confocal observation. Fluorescence images were captured by a CV1000 confocal microscope (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
