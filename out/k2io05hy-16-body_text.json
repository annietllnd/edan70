The pCI-neo vector and Seg-9 PCR products were double-digested with EcoRI and NotI (BTV-8) or EcoRI and XbaI (GIV) enzymes. Digested products were gel purified using Genclean kit (Qbiogen). Corresponding vectors and PCR products were ligated overnight (O/N) at 16uC using T4 DNA ligase (Roche) to generate pGEX-BTVNS4, pGEX-GIVNS4, pCI-BTVNS4 or pCI-GIVNS4. These recombinant plasmids were used to transform XL1-Blue bacteria (Stratagene). Clones were recovered and grown in trypticase-soy-casein (TSC) medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. The plamsids were subsequently purified using Qiaquick plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the D-Rhodamine DNA sequencing kit and an ABI prism 377 sequence analyser (Perkin Elmer).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
