Given that CEACAM/PSGs could act through homophilic and heterophilic interactions [7, 9] , the pressure to select new variants could be self-enforced if the carrier of a new immuno-modulation CEACAM/PSG variant favors fetus with the new variant as a result of immunocompatibility. By the same token, this mechanism could also contribute to the high population differentiation of select CEACAM/PSG variants. Therefore, our finding could represent an important vehicle for exploring novel genotype-phenotype relationships in PSG-mediated fetal-maternal interactions. In addition, our study raised the possibility that genetic variations at the PSG locus could be involved in the manifestation of reduced fertility and various pregnancy complications in select individuals. In support of our speculation, a recent report indicated that there could be a nominal relationship between PSG11 gene copy variation and the occurrence of preeclampsia [88] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
