In this team, there are cooperative interactions when one member helps another one to work more efficiently. In fact, antioxidant defence systems are shown to be found in all cell compartments (e.g., mitochondria, nucleus, cytoplasm, etc.) and are expressed tissue-specifically, which includes internally synthesised antioxidants (AO enzymes, GSH, CoQ, uric acid, carnitine, taurine, etc.) and antioxidants supplied with the diet (vitamin E, carotenoids, synthetic antioxidants, carnitine, silymarin, etc.). Many antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD, GPx and some other selenoproteins, etc.) are stress-inducible and their expression and activity depend on stress intensity [15] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
