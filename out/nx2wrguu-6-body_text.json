There are four antigenically related serotypes (DENV1 to 4) , and first infection with one serotype is often self-limiting [5] , eliciting specific acquired immunity. However, following primary infection with one serotype, infected and recovered individuals remain prone to secondary infection with other serotypes that could induce a clinically severe form of infection, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [6, 7] . DENV infections are seen mostly in tropical and subtropical countries, but nonendemic areas in temperate regions are also at risk [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] , owing partly to the changing ecological dynamics of vector abundance, perhaps induced by global warming [12] and an increased volume of international travel [13] . Although vaccination is partly underway in endemic countries, concrete plans for the prevention and specific treatment of dengue have yet to be fully established [7, 14] . Moreover, the possible drawbacks of vaccination in lowendemicity settings remain a controversial issue [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
