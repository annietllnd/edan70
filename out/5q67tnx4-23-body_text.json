They have shown to detect very low concentrations CPV and feline parvovirus in unprocessed fecal samples, and have been more useful to diagnose and differentiate canine enteric pathogens as the definitive diagnosis is important primarily for epidemic control and prevention [24] . The PCR assays avoid the necessity for culture for subsequent phenotypic tests and that when employed to a large number of diarrheic samples help in clarifying the role of a particular organism in the enteric disease [12] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
