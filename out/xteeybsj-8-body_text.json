At one farm (F30), only the females demonstrated anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies, and all other categories were seronegative for this virus. Additionally, 28 of 30 farms (93Á3%) had at least one piglet from the farrowing crates cycle with at least low antibody titers against the pandemic virus. Grower and finisher pigs from 17 farms were all seronegative for H1N1pdm09. A total of 98Á33% of grower pigs in areas 1 and 3 were seronegative for H1N1pdm09 virus, and the percentage of seronegative animals in the finisher pig cycle was lower than that in the grower pig cycle for all studied areas. Overall, the percentage of pigs seronegative for H1N1pdm09 virus increased with age, and the highest values were observed in nursery pigs (areas 2 and 4) and grower pigs (areas 1 and 3) (Figure 3 ). Interestingly, one area 1 farm (F6) and two area 3 farms (F21 and F22) had respiratory outbreaks, with influenza virus confirmed as a primary causative agent, a few months prior to sample collection. At that time, clinical disease occurred mostly in nursery and grower pigs, thus corroborating our findings demonstrating susceptibility at these ages. Figure 4 shows the antibody distribution at all four farms with animals that were seropositive for H3N2 SIV virus. The most varied profile of antibodies against H3N2 SIV virus was observed at Farm 27 (area 4), at which the pigs showed low to medium antibody levels. Farms 7 (area 2) and 29 (area 4) had only two and one females, respectively, with anti-H3N2 ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
