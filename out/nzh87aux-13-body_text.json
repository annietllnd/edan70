Suppose now that a flight arrives with one, or more, infected passengers who mix within the community. We classify these infected arrivals into those who are 'pre-symptomatic' and those who are 'symptomatic' at entry. It is assumed that the 'symptomatic' infected arrivals do not recognize their symptoms as pandemic influenza and will not present to medical authorities. In other words, they spend the remainder of their infectious period mixing in the community. On the other hand, the 'presymptomatic' infected arrivals, including all individuals infected during flight, are assumed to mix freely in the community only from entry until they present to medical authorities after some delay following the onset of symptoms.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
