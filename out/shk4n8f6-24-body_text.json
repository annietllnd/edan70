Viral pseudotyped particles harboring the HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) were produced by transfection in Hek-293T cells of vectors encoding viral glycoproteins, packaging proteins and a Luciferase marker. After 48 h, viral pseudoparticle supernatants were harvested and filtered through 45-μ M filters to remove the cell debris. For the entry assay, Huh7.5 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA in 96-well plates. After 48 h, the cells were infected with 50 μ l HCVpp containing supernatant. Forty-eight hours post-infection, the cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed in 20 μ l luciferase lysis buffer (RLB) and stored at − 80 °C until measurement of luciferase activity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
