In the pre-antibiotic years, the bacterial etiology for pneumonia was most commonly (> 90%) due to S. pneumoniae, but the incidence of bacterial etiologies for pneumonia has been decreasing in recent years especially with the availability of vaccines like the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 or Pneumovax ® ) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or Prevnar 13 ® ) [2] . Currently <15% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia are due to S. pneumoniae, likely due to increases in vaccination rates against this pathogen [3] . Viral etiologies are now identified in 25% of patients, with many of these patients having bacterial coinfections with viral respiratory pathogens resulting in decreased mucociliary clearance of bacteria [3, 4] . Examples of this pathology include influenza decreasing clearance of S. pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) inducing the adherence cells [4] . Complicating the diagnoses of patients, some respiratory pathogens are frequently detected in healthy patients with colonization, resulting in a questionable causative role in LRTIs [5] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
