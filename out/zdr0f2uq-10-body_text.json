For example, the capacity of the avian influenza HA to interact with both α2,3-and α2,6-linked sialic acid has been shown to facilitate spill-over of the virus from birds to humans [53, 62, 63] . In addition, differential expression of these sialic acid structures between the upper and lower respiratory tracts in humans can shape the distribution of influenza infection within an individual [64, 65] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
