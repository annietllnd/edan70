Compounds 12, 14 and 20 were incubated with EV-B93 3C protease. The enzyme was repurified by size-exclusion chromatography and subjected to crystallization trials. The protein complex with 14 gave well-diffracting crystals, which showed the presence of additional electron density in the active site corresponding to the molecular structure of the inhibitor. The high-resolution structure (PDB: 5IYT, 1.73 Ã…) of the protease-inhibitor complex revealed several additional aspects of the inhibition of the protease with compound 14.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
