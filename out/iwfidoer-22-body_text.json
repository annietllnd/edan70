Among the RNA viral genomes obtained in this study, some dominant populations showed greater similarities to fungal viruses than to known diatom viruses; however, several ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have already been identified from marine diatoms (20, 43) . We cannot exclude the possibility that these viral genomes were derived from fungi associated with a diatom colony, but it is more likely that they came from the major components of a diatom colony because of their high abundance in the RNA viral metagenomic library. Since extracellular viral particles have been a major target of virus surveillance and isolation, information on intracellular viruses in microorganisms is very limited (13, 37) . Therefore, the accumulation of knowledge on intracellular RNA viruses infecting diverse host organisms is essential for understanding the evolution and distribution of RNA viruses. FLDS revealed 22 full-length and some partial composite viral RNA genomes associated with a diatom colony by de novo assembly. These were classified into five dsRNA (Totiviridae, Endornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Cystoviridae, and Partitiviridae) and four ssRNA (Flaviviridae, Narnaviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hypoviridae) virus families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of full-length genome sequences of novel RNA viruses identified in one metagenomic library. The viral RNA community successfully detected in this study consisted of dsRNA viruses with or without virion formation and ssRNA viruses detected as replicative intermediates. Our results suggest that FLDS has the potential to detect a wide range of RNA viruses, excluding retroviruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
