Seven distinct structural proteins (VP1 to VP7) and 3 distinct non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2 and NS3) were identified in orbivirus infected cells, or after in vitro translation of viral RNA. In most cases each genome segment encodes a single protein from a single open reading frame (ORF), expect segment 9 (Seg-9) and segment 10 (Seg-10), both of which encode two nearly identical proteins initiated from in-phase AUG codons close together near the upstream termini (VP6 and VP6a encoded by Seg-9, and NS3 and NS3a encoded by Seg-10) [2, 5] . However, in vitro translation of BTV RNA segments reproducibly generated a number of smaller translation products of unknown significance, that were usually dismissed as unimportant byproducts of translation [2] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
