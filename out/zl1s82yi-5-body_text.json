Any contribution from endogenous MS2 RNA was ruled out since no MS2 RNA was amplified from any of these 93 stool suspensions upon extraction with protocol D when exogenous MS2 was omitted from the lysis buffer. Results for each extraction procedure by assigned levels of inhibition are shown in Table 1 . Individual values are shown in Fig. S1 . The proportion of samples with inhibitors varied among the extraction methods. Of the 93 RNA extracts, 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) extracted by protocols A, B, C, and D, respectively, contained inhibitors of MS2 rRT-PCR. Median interquartile range (IQR) reduction in Cts for protocols A, B, C and D were 2.4 (0 to 34), 1.9 (0 to 33), 0.58 (0 to 29), and 0.26 (0 to 7), respectively. Finally, the number of samples with an inhibition .6 Ct were 6 (6.5%), 3 (6.4%), 2 (2.2%), and 1 (1.1%) for Extraction Protocols A through D, respectively. The Friedman Test indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in co-extraction of inhibitors of MS2 rRT-PCR among the extraction protocols used, P,0.001.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
