It is well known that the three-dimensional structure of proteins is conserved over larger evolutionary distances than their sequences, and thus, several viral families can share a common fold of the capsid, although the sequences have diverged beyond similarity detection [8] . In certain cases, such viruses can be proven to have a common origin, particularly when the Baltimore class is also the same [10] , but the relatedness to viruses of a different Baltimore class is more difficult to establish [11] . Therefore, an alternative hypothesis of viral evolution has been proposed that considers the capsid as the central defining element of the viral evolution, and viruses are suggested to be called "capsid-encoded organisms" [12] . A comparison of capsid proteins allowed for proposing a novel classification of viruses into so-called lineages [13] . A lineage unites several viral families, whose capsid proteins have similar folds, but otherwise, their proteins can share little or no sequence similarity. Whereas the dimensions and subunit organization of the capsids can vary within the same lineage, virions often possess other common structural features, e.g., spikes attached to five-fold icosahedral vertices of the capsid [13] . Viral lineages also may share certain details of genome organization [14] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
