For the group I intron, we found the approach could predict the pseudoknot between the P3 and P6 stems successfully (Fig. 2c ) [19] . However, the Flory model [20] and/or the McKenzie-Moore-Domb-Fisher model (Ref. [13] ) becomes important for long compact functional RNA structures where polymer-solvent interactions begin to dominate. In Fig. 2b , the structure is fitted using d = 1.4, c = 1.5 and default parameters for the effective Flory model. The parameter d reflects the extent or weight of the correlation in the polymer chain: a large value for d indicates that the memory of the previous monomer dies off very rapidly and a small value suggests that the information persists in the structure over a much longer distance. The default parameter is d = 2 (the Gaussian distribution). The parameter c scales the volume occupied by a polymer in accordance with a self avoiding random walk [13] . This suggests that long sequences with extended interactions also tend to have more correlation over the entire sequence and the dimensionality may be slightly reduced. Many of these structures fold correctly with a variety of parameter values, but long sequences appear to favor smaller values for d, and c.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
