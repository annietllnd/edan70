Although quite some polar/electrostatic interactions are present in the interface, the heart of the interactions is the formation of a hydrophobic network (Fig. 4) . This involves residues Pro113, Leu115, and Trp121 from the MTase, and Phe467 (ring) Phe351 (index/bNLS core helix), and Pro585 (middle) from the RdRP fingers domain arranged in an alternating fashion (Figs. 2A, 3A, and 4) . Notably, none of these six residues participates in catalysis, but five out of the six are highly conserved across the flavivirus genus, with the only exception being residue 115 that is also mostly hydrophobic (Fig. 3C) , strongly implying the biological relevance of this observed conformation. Pro113/Leu115/Trp121 reside at the peripheral of the 7-stranded b-sheet that forms the base of the MTase catalytic platform. With the RdRP approaches almost perpendicular to the catalytic cleft, the SAM-binding, cap-binding, and 59 RNA binding sites are fully accessible in this conformation (Fig. 3A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
