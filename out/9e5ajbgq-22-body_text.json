However, a slight reduction in overall performance from 88 to 80% was noted, signifying the influence of individual or personal factors (represented in the remaining three risk domains) on dental caries experience in children; the overall performance of model with variables representing socioeconomic status was 59%. In addition, the higher magnitude of adjusted odds ratios of individual factors (ranging from 4.4 to 38.4) compared to aORs of socioeconomic factors (ranging from 4.2 to 28.2) and the lower confidence limits that were consistently above 1.5 lend further support to the predominant ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
