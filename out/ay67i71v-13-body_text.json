The mean (SD) of the attitude scores was 32.65 (4.72). Forty-five (20.0%) of the participants strongly agreed that since the bird flu, SARS, MERS-COV, and H1N1 crises were over, they no longer needed to worry about contracting flu-like illnesses, as shown in Table 3 . However, regarding attitudes towards face mask, only 5.8% and 1.3% of participants disagreed and strongly disagreed with the opinion of being opposed to face mask usage, respectively. Table 4 shows the responses of the participants regarding the various preventive practices using 13 questions. The mean (SD) of the total practice score of the participants is 25.30 (4.9) . Among the pilgrims, 38 (16.9%) had a good practice and 187 (83.1%) had a poor practice towards respiratory tract infection prevention. The majority of the pilgrims occasionally eat vegetable and fruits (61.8% and 63.6%, respectively).

About 24.0% of the respondents always refrain from being close to those that cough or sneeze. However, less than half of the respondents reported practicing receiving a flu vaccine.
