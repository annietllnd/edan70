In brief, parasites were maintained in culture using 5% haematocrit of human group O + blood in parasite medium consisting of RPMI1640 HEPES medium, supplemented with 25 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.125 g/l gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 0.125 g/l Albumax II (Invitrogen). Culture flasks were maintained in a 37Â°C incubator and gassed with a mixture of 2% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The parasite lines were confirmed to be monoclonal and of same genotype as 3D7, using nested GLURP, and MSP2-specific primers in a single PCR step.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
