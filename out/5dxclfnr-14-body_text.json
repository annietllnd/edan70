Both classes of these splicing regulators show dual and antagonistic functionality in a strict position-dependent manner [33] . Accordingly, expression, positioning and activity of these proteins are critical to splice site selection. A growing body of evidence reveals the contribution of signaling pathways controlling alternative splicing by transmitting incoming signals to the splicing machinery. This allows a faster reaction to changing environmental conditions as transcript variants of different stability or protein isoforms can be generated in the absence of a new round of transcription.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
