In contrast, Jackson and coworkers suggested an NS1-mediated, but PI3K-independent, prevention of apoptosis as NS1 mutant viruses induced apoptosis, while FCS-activated Akt was not able to overcome this effect [61] . Even though strain-specific viral requirements for NS1-activated PI3K have been discovered, mere strain-specificity cannot explain the observed differences concerning the role of PI3K in NS1-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling, since both labs used the same influenza A strain [62, 63] . However, Ayllon and colleagues, using mouse-adapted viruses, demonstrated in vivo subtle differences in NS1 protein localizations depending on the NS1 isoform, which only differs in seven amino acids between the two strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/WSN/33. Applying a cell-based assay, they observed that PR8/NS1-induced PIP 3 , the target of PI3K, appeared to accumulate in microdomains whereas WSN/NS1-induced PIP 3 was broadly distributed throughout the plasma membrane, which may explain that different NS1 variants define intracellular sites of PI3K activation [62, 63] . To entirely decode how influenza A virus impacts the PI3K signaling pathway, the authors suggest carefully selecting the viral strain, host-cell type, time post-infection and the PI3K isotype to be used in further experiments [62] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
