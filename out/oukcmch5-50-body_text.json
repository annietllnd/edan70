Briefly, 7'500 HeLa cells were seeded one day prior to transfection in a 96-well plate. Using Oligofectamine (Life Technologies) reagent three independent, non-overlapping RAB7A siRNAs (pre-designed Silencer Select siRNAs from Ambion) per gene were individually transfected into target cells with the mRFP-RAB7A plasmid. Transfection mix for one well contained 2.5 ml of 1 mM siRNA, 10 ng plasmid, and 0.5 ml Oligofectamine in 12.5 ml OptiMEM (Gibco). Transfection was done in 62.5 ml final volume of OptiMEM. 4 hours post transfection 125 ml of DMEM, 30% FBS were added. RFP expression was analyzed 24 h post transfection using an EVOS Cell Imaging System.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
