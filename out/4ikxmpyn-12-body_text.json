DAI/ZBP1 interacts with the IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase subunit PB1 after infection. DAI/ZBP1 subsequently interacts with RIP3 through their shared domain homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the RIP1-RIP3-caspase-8 pathway (37) (38) (39) . It is evident that the viral protein sensor DAI/ZBP1 is critical to the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated apoptotic and necroptotic cell death since DAI/ZBP1 deficient mouse were protected from mortality during IAV infection. However, viral RNA or proteins alone were not sufficient to induce DAI/ZBP1-mediated cell death during IAV infection (40) . Instead, during viral replication, DAI/ZBP1 senses the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP), containing IAV RNA, NP, and PB1, and subsequently initiates programmed cell death (40) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
