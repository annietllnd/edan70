This correlates with the predominant localization of receptors for human ( 2,6-linked sialic acids) and avian ( 2,3-linked sialic acids) viruses on nonciliated and ciliated cells, respectively [53] . Sialic acid linked to galactose via 2,3 glycosidic bonds, is a cellular receptor located in the eye, which may account for the ocular tropism exhibited by some zoonotic avian influenza A viruses [38] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
