However, the identification of antibody types may help to determine the course of disease, and BIE may be used as a clinical primary screening tool for CMV patients. IgM is produced in large amounts early in infection (reaching a peak in the first month), and is followed by IgG production [7, 31] . Levels of IgM decline in the months following the onset of infection, whereas IgG levels persist for the rest of the patient's life [32, 33] . Determining IgG avidity can provide additional guidance on infection status, and low avidity IgG is initially present but increases over time [34] . A positive result for IgM combined with low-to-moderate IgG suggests avidity a primary CMV infection within the past 3 to 4 months [35] . The visualized BIE image (Fig 2) could reflect types via difference in brightness, so this technology can achieve rapid screening. To date, our work is simply a demonstration for IgG type antibody detection with BIE. IgM and other antibodies needed to screen for specific antigen can be incorporated in the future for further practical applications.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
