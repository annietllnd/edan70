Plasmids encoding mRFP-tagged RAB5A or RAB7A, or dsRed-LAMP1 [104] were transfected into the cells one day after seeding using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection MHV-DyLight488 was bound to cells on ice at MOI = 20 for 1.5 h in DMEM, 2% FBS. The inoculum was removed and cells washed with cold PBS to remove unbound virus. Warm imaging medium (DMEM without phenol red, 10% FCS) containing 0.008% trypan blue (Invitrogen) was added to the cell chambers. The cell membrane impermeable trypan blue shifts the expression spectrum of cell surface bound particles rendering them undetectable in the 505-530 nm channel (described in [65] ). Different low to medium RFP expressing cells were imaged live at 37uC, 5% CO 2 in 10 min time frames from 10 min post warming up to 70 min in 30 s intervals thereby acquiring z-stack images. Each slice was 0.30 mm in thickness, averaging 12-14 slices per stack. For recording a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverse spinning-disk confocal microscope, equipped with full box stage incubation, including CO 2 (Pecon), argon-krypton and helium-neon laser, two Photometrics Evolve 512 back-illuminated electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device (EM-CCD) cameras, and 10061.46NA Oil alpha Plan Apochromat objective was used. Fluorescence images were exported as.czi files (Zeiss) and subsequently imported into Fiji (ImageJ, NIH).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
