To deplete cholesterol, a 50 mM stock solution of methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared by dissolving in nanopure water. Cells were incubated with 10 mM MbCD for 1 h at 37uC. All cells were rinsed with PBS once before being processed for imaging.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
