Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was prepared with 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 (pH 7.3) in deionized water. PBST buffer was prepared with 1% Tween-20 in PBS. CMV-3A (0.1 mg/mL) was prepared with PBST. BSA (10 mg/mL) was prepared with PBST. The blocking reagent was a 1:1 (vol:vol) mixture of 10 mg/mL BSA and 10Ã— Blocking Buffer. Purified CMV antibody, IgG, anti-IgG, and anti-IgM were diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL with PBST. Serum samples were diluted as indicated with PBST for qualitative or quantitative detection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
