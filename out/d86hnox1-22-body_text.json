In prokaryotic genomes, a slight preference for F = −2 was noted in surviving overlapping genes. Indeed, the coding properties of this scheme are especially favorable, and we analyze them briefly here. In this frame, each X′ codon has its middle nucleotide in register with a Y′ wobble nucleotide, and vice versa. Since the wobble nucleotide has little effect on the coded amino acid, this allows the middle nucleotide of each X′ and Y′ codon to be chosen almost freely. Figure 6 shows two sense/antisense codons that share their first bases. We denote them  and . We denote the sense nucleotides 1, 2, 3 and the antisense nucleotides 1′, 2′, 3′. The possible amino acid choices for  and  are listed in Table 2 . If we classify the 20 amino acid types into four classes: Π = (large, polar), Φ = (large, nonpolar), π = (small, polar), ϕ = (small, nonpolar), with four choices of class on each strand, there are 16 possible / S A combinations. Despite the base-pairing constraint, 15 of them can be encoded freely in this overlap scheme. Only the combination (π, π) cannot be encoded unambiguously. In contrast, the F = 0 frame (central bases opposite) can only encode 26 of 20 × 20 possible pairs of amino acid types.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
