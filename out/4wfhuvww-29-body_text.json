FRET is a useful technique to measure proximity of biomolecules. A donor fluorophore attached to a molecule can transfer photons to an acceptor fluorophore on a different molecule when both molecules are close together (generally less than 10 nm). Aitken and Puglisi have used this technique to label individual tRNA molecules with donor and acceptor dyes that result in energy transfer when in close proximity and correct orientation. This technique enables to monitor relative tRNA positions and movement of tRNAs on ribosomes at a millisecond scale. It has been used to identify ribosomal translocation events on fluorescent ribosomes on immobilized RNA sequences and predicted the slipperiness of various RNA sequences. Again, this will be technically difficult to implement on a genome-wide scale.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
