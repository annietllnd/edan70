For microscopy studies, 293T cells cultured in chamber slides were transfected with human tetherin in the absence or presence of Vpu and SGTA. Twenty-four h posttransfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 4 min, washed in PBS and incubated with 0.1 M glycine-PBS for 10 min to quench the remaining aldehyde residues. After blocking with 3% BSA-PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-HA, and either Zenon Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-Vpu or Zenon Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-calnexin appropriately diluted in 3% BSA-PBS for 1 h. In triple antibody staining experiments, cells were first incubated with anti-FLAG antibody diluted in 3% BSA-PBS for 1 h, then cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 diluted in 3% BSA-PBS. After washing with PBS three times, cells were incubated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-HA and Zenon Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-Vpu. Finally, after washing with PBS three times, cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and examined with a Delta-Vision RT microscope.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
