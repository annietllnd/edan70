Three groups of five cattle per group and a control group of two non-vaccinated animals were vaccinated. The vaccinated groups were administered different doses (1 dose, 1/3 dose, 1/9 dose)of the subunit vaccine prepared from diluted expression products and all animals were challenged 3 weeks after vaccination with 10,000 BID 50 of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 to the vaccine under test by intradermal inoculation into two sites on the upper surface of the tongue. The animals were observed daily for 10 days after challenge for clinical signs of FMD. Control animals developed lesions on at least three feet. Unprotected animals showed lesions at sites other than the tongue. From each animal protected in each group, the PD 50 (50% bovine protective dose) content of the vaccine was calculated based on the Reed-Muench method.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
