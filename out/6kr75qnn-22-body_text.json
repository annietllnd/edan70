After lysis of cell pellets and purification of RNA and DNA, nucleic acid amplification was performed using degenerate primers targeting conserved regions of major virus families or genera ( Table S1 ). All sequences obtained were identified as host sequences; no sequences from viral or bacterial organisms were found.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
