Advances in genetic identification by biomolecular technologies allow rapid identification of viruses without the need for prior isolation. However, the question remains as to whether these novel viruses cause disease in the species that they were found [8, 3] . There have been few instances where isolates were obtained, such as a virus that was found in peafowl that was found to share >99% identity with H120 IBV vaccines [18] and Mass-type IBV [19] . A coronavirus detected in pigeons was found to be clustered as a Masstype IBV [20] , whereas a coronavirus found in teal has been shown to exhibit >80% genetic similarity with several IBV strains including infectious strains [21] . Interestingly, upon exposure to chickens, the peafowl IB-like virus, which is close to IBV vaccine strain H120, did not cause disease among these birds [18] , whereas the IB-like Mass-type peafowl isolate, the IB-like Mass-type pigeon isolate, and the IB-like teal isolate caused infection in chickens [19, 20, 21] . These previous studies indicate that the IB-like virus may be found in hosts other than chickens and that they might originate from the chicken IBV or might be a novel virus. However, unless this is investigated further, it is uncertain whether the viruses found in other species of birds can cause disease in chickens.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
