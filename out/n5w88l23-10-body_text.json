The protein purified from the soluble supernatant by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography (HiTrap HP; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was eluted with Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM imidazole, and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.9) and dialyzed against a dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0; Buffer B). Protein purity remained >97% as determined by SDS-PAGE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
