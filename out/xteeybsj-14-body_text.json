The levels of anti-influenza antibodies decrease over time, and in some studies, maternally derived antibody levels were undetectable in animals between nine and 10 weeks of age. 25, 27 These results may explain why pigs later in the nursery age and early in the growing period are more vulnerable to influenza virus infection. Moreover, the timing of influenza infection may vary based on the type of production system. 21 A study comparing the timing of infection in finisher pigs in nonvaccinated farrow-to-finish herds and specialized finishing herds showed that infection was highest at the beginning of the finishing period in farrow-to-finish herds, while in finishing herds, the incidence of influenza infections was highest in the end of the same period. 21 Differences in the time of influenza infection occurrence may require different preventive measures, and because passive antibodies may interfere in the immune response to vaccination or infection, vaccination strategies must be analyzed to improve protection against influenza infection. Based on our results, it is not possible to suggest a single vaccination program against influenza virus because susceptible animals were generally detected in all categories of the production system. Thus, some strategies, such as female-only vaccination or female vaccination followed by vaccination of pigs at 7-8 weeks, could be helpful, depending on the immunity of the herd.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
