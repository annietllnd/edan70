Clinically the disease manifests by reproductive disorders in sows and respiratory lesions and poor growth performance in growing pigs. The etiological agent of the disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-strand RNA virus classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae. Two genotypes, Type 1 and Type 2, sharing approximately 60% of genetic similarity were described [1] . A newly proposed classification denotes both types as different species within Arteriviridae family (https ://talk.ictvo nline .org/taxon omy/). Type 1 can be further divided into at least four genetic subtypes, namely Pan-European subtype 1 and subtypes 2, 3 and 4 represented by strains circulating in Eastern European countries [2] . Gathering evidences suggest the existence of additional 1 3 subtypes. However, the genetic subtyping based on a small genomic fragment of ORF5 and ORF7 can be affected by genetic recombination [3] [4] [5] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
