This study was undertaken on three groups of cats. Group 1.1 comprised 16 cats with FIP, further subdivided into natural infection (12 pet cats; age: 5 months to 2 years; Group 1.1a) and experimental infection (four female specific pathogen free (SPF) cats; age: 14-16 weeks; Group 1.1b), see Table 1 . All 1.1a cats were submitted for diagnostic post mortem examination with full owner consent. The 1.1b cats had been euthanased with FIP after experimental intra-peritoneal infection with the serotype I FCoV strain FIPV-UCD at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Approval for this experiment was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Utrecht University (approval number: 0502.0802). All Group 1.1b cats showed clinical signs of FIP which necessitated euthanasia of two cats at 3.5 and 4 weeks post infection (p.i.) whilst the remaining two were euthanased at the end of the experiment (11 weeks p.i.).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
