Because our structural data indicated that this region forms a dimer, we investigated the role of FLASH NTD dimerization in Lsm11 binding. Previous pull-down studies showed that substituting Leu118 and Ile119 with alanines abolished the ability of FLASH to bind Lsm11 [28] . According to our FLASH NTD structures, both Leu118 and Ile119 are situated at the dimer interface ( Fig 4A) . It was possible that these mutations disrupt FLASH NTD dimerization, thereby affecting Lsm11 binding. To test this possibility, we generated the FLASH NTD L118A/I119A mutant in the background of C54S/C83A mutations and investigated its oligomeric state by analytical gel filtration (Fig 4B) . Our results showed that this mutant had a similar migration behavior as the C54S/C83A mutant control, indicating that the deleterious effect of L118A/I119A mutation on binding Lsm11 is not due to the disruption of FLASH NTD dimerization.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
