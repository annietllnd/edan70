The tree with the highest log likelihood is presented. The topology of the tree was constructed using proml in Phylip v3.69 [38] . Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths which were estimated using codeml of PAML [39] . The bootstrap values of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together shown next to the branches were obtained from 100 replicates.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
