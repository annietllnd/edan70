The observation differed to what we generally expected, so it is worthy of thinking the sense of IFITM1 expression upregulated by viral particle. Moreover, a recent study indicated that H9N2 influenza virus infection induces the expression of IFITM1 in lung, heart and liver in BALB/c mice [44] . In vivo, the basal lamina with an average thickness of 1 μm is the only structure which separates epithelial cells and endothelial cells [45] . Death of infected epithelial cells creates gaps and the released virus particles readily access to endothelial cells [46, 47] . Thus, the released virus particles may stimulate the antiviral response in endothelial cells. In addition, cytokines produced by epithelial cells could further activate neighboring endothelial cells during influenza virus infection [48] . So it is conceivable that interferon-α/β released by infected epithelial cells could readily induce the expression of IFITM proteins in endothelial cells. Taken together, we may consider to enhance the antiviral state of host by stimulating the respiratory tract with inactivated viral particles.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
