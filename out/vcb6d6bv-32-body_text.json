The final quaternary structure of M2 is not primarily driven by van der Waals forces (as expected for most TM proteins) but by inter-helical hydrogen bonds and cation-Ï€ interactions between residues facing the aqueous pore within (a type of interaction that might not be unique of M2). These residues are also necessary for the proton transfer activity of the protein, representing a beautiful example of functional linkage and highlighting the plasticity and multi-functionality of TM domains.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
