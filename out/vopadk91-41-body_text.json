BHK cells were grown to 95% confluence in 12.5-cm 2 flasks and transfected with 6 g of infectious cDNA clone and 18 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. At 6 h posttransfection (hpt), cells were trypsinized, added to confluent Vero E6 cells monolayers grown in 12.5-cm 2 flasks, and incubated at 37Â°C for 72 h. Cell supernatants were harvested and passaged once on fresh cells, and the recovered viruses were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification following standard procedures.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
