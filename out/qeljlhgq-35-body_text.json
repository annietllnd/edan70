These covariates were taken forward to the H5N6 INLA model. The variable "Round" was forced into the model to account for temporal variation in the sampling. The CAR model based on these variables had a DIC value of 202.36, inclusion of the spatial random effect "province" did not improve the model fit (the DIC was lowered by 0.03% to 202.29). Therefore, the final model used for H5N6 therefore did not include the spatially varying random effect. The likelihood of a market day being positive for H5N6 was higher with successive Rounds and lower river density ( Table 5) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
