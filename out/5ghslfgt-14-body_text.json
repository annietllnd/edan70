The sub-epidemic model also has significantly higher upper bounds, suggesting the possibility of up to 1853 cases, while the GLM and Richards only predict up to 1276 and 1279, respectively. As of 13 February 2020, Zhejiang has a total cumulative reported case count of 1145 [1] ; therefore, the models are predicting an additional 36-260 cases in the next five days (UB: 131-708).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
