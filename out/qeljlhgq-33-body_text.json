{"cord_uid":"qeljlhgq", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC5896172", "divid":31, "text":"Province-level Bayes-smoothed prevalence of H5N1-positive market days was spatially heterogeneous in all six Rounds, although it was highest in Rounds 2 and 6 ( Figure 1) . This apparent spatial heterogeneity was supported by both the global and local autocorrelation statistics, which identified significant positive spatial autocorrelation in all rounds except Round 2 (Moran's I p-value > 0.05; Figure 2 ). The positive autocorrelation was characterised by repeated occurrence, in the south of the country, of a cluster of high-risk provinces surrounded by other high-risk provinces, although the size of the cluster varied between Rounds (Figure 2) . Conversely, northern Vietnam was characterised by low-risk provinces surrounded by other provinces of low risk. However, the north also exhibited periodic recurrent outliers; provinces with a high disease risk but surrounded by others with a low disease risk (Figure 2) . Hot-spot provinces were identified in all Rounds but the number decreased over time (Rounds 1-3: n = 4; Rounds 4-5: n = 2; Round 6: n = 1) (Figure 3) . One province, in particular, Ca Mau was identified as a hot-spot province of H5N1-positive market days in four of the six rounds. Unlike H5N1, province-level empirical Bayes-smoothed risk of H5N6-positive market days did not display any significant spatial heterogeneity in any of the Rounds (Moran's I p-value > 0.05) although the level of risk increased between Rounds 4 and 6 ( Figure 4) . In general, the most common pattern was one of outliers; provinces with a high risk of H5N6-positive market days were generally surrounded by low-risk provinces and vice versa (Figure 5) . Two hot-spot provinces were identified in each Round although Quang Ngai was the only province to be identified as a hot spot more than once (Rounds 4 and 5; Figure 6 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
