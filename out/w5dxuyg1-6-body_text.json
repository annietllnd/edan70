We then used a palette of methods on selected cases to confirm translation and identify the cell source of the cytokines. In light of both our previous findings in lymphatic tissues [20, 21] and the importance of these cytokines in determining the balance of the immune response (Th1 vs. Th2/pro-vs. anti-inflammatory [32, 33] ), we also evaluated the hepatic IL-10 and IL-12p40 mRNA levels in an attempt to assess whether this ratio correlated with the clinical picture.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
