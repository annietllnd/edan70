Reactions were prepared in volumes of 20 μl using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (QIAGEN) and a primer concentration of 1 μM. The following PCR cycling conditions were used: initial heat activation step at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 68°C for 40 s with a final extension at 68°C for 40 s. The amplification specificity for each primer pair was determined by melting-curve analysis of each PCR product.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
