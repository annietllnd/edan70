The 9 surviving mice showed body weight at 90 to 110% range during the observation period (Fig. S2C) . On the other hand, 10 (53%) mice did not develop neutralizing antibodies; 3 survived ( Fig.  S2D) and 7 died (Fig. S2E and F) after wt RVFV challenge. Among the 3 survivors, 2 developed anti-N IgG (1:204,800) and the other (#14-3) did not raise anti-N IgG. The mouse #14-3 showed temporal 16% body weight reduction at 7 days post challenge (Fig. S2D) , and also developed neutralizing antibodies (1:2,560) at 21 days post challenge. On the other hand, rMP12-NSsR173A showed poor efficacy (50% survival) ( Table 1) . Three surviving mice (30%) vaccinated with rMP12-NSsR173A developed both neutralizing antibody (1:10 to 1:160) and anti-N IgG (1:400 to 1:6,400) (Fig. S2G) , while 2 surviving mice (20%) had developed anti-N IgG (1:800 to 1:6,400) without neutralizing antibody (Fig. S2H) . On the other hand, the remaining 5 mice (50%) died without the presence of neutralizing antibodies (3 mice developed 1:400 to 1:3,200 of anti-N IgG) (Fig. S2I and J) . Together with previous observation that rMP12-NSsR173A does not efficiently accumulate viral proteins due to PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation [52] , this result suggests that MP-12 encoding a mutant NSs, which inhibits host general transcription including IFN-b gene, but does not promote PKR degradation, is not immunogenic, and poorly induces neutralizing antibodies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
