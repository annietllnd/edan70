As shown in Fig. 2 , the proliferation rate of synovial cells was markedly higher in the control group compared with the other groups (P<0.05). In the SH-treated groups, the proliferation rates of synovial cells were significantly decreased compared with those in group 1 (P<0.05 for group 2; P<0.01 for groups [3] [4] [5] . These results indicated that SH decreased the level of synovial proliferation in cells from a patient with RA. Fig. 3 shows the inhibition rate of different concentrations of SH on synovial proliferation. The inhibition rates of different concentrations of SH are shown numerically in Table I and the correlation coefficient was found to be 0.961718.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
