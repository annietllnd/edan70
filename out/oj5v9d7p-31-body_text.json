In particular, at least four different mechanisms are described which could lead to dissociation of Keap1 from Nrf2: oxidation of cysteine residues (lower molecular weight reactive oxygen species); covalent modification of cysteine residues (electrophiles); phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 by protein kinase C and PERK; and protein-protein interaction between p62 and Keap1 [200] . Indeed, Nrf2 activation is responsible for the regulation of multiple pathways via direct inactivation of oxidants, increasing levels of GSH, Trx and NADPH synthesis, enhancing toxin export via the multidrug response transporters, inhibiting cytokine-mediated inflammation, enhancing recognition, repair and removal of damaged proteins, increasing chaperones and regulating posttranslational protein modifications (Table 3 ) [201, 202] .
