As shown in Fig. 1a , the results confirmed that all the human H7s descended from the same ancestor. Most of the HAs from 2013 to 2014 were very similar and formed a cluster. However, after the initial outbreak, a broad dissemination of the virus was observed that indicated the occurrence of more frequent amino acid changes in HA. Previously, we reported that an H7N9-neutralizing antibody, HNIgGA6, recognized the viral receptor binding site (RBS) on HA1 23 . To evaluate potential antigenic drift, we performed an alignment of 12 randomly selected HA1 sequences and assessed the amino acid substitutions in the viral RBS. As shown in Fig. 1b , many amino acid changes occurred, most of which were in the hypervariable region around the receptor-binding pocket.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
