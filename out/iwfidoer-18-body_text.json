Sequence reads derived from rRNA were identified using EMIRGE (26) . The results of the analysis revealed that 56% of all trimmed reads were rRNA sequences, while 37.2% of all reads showed more than 99% identity to 18S and 23S rRNA from the diatom Achnanthes brevipes. In addition, 4.1 and 6.2% of reads belonged to the other diatom genus Cylindrotheca and chlorophyte genus Cladophora, respectively. The relative abundance of the rRNA reads was shown in Table S4 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
