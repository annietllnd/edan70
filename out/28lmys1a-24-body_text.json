Hourly wages for management are higher than those for paid employees as shown in Table 1 . Employees contributed more to the total cost than management in conventional and automatic systems even though their hourly rate is lower. Labor costs associated with the automatic calf feeder were responsible for 23% of the total labor cost. Labor cost of individual housing and group housing contributed 33% and 26%, respectively. The minutes and total cost per hourly laborer were decreased from inside individual housing to group housing by 36% per calf for a value of 2.4 minutes or $0.50 per calf per day. This shows a reduction in overall labor cost but an increased demand for fixed and variable expenses. These include the paying for the feeder, annual maintenance and a barn to house calves.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
