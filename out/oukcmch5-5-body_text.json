Clathrin-dependent as well as clathrin-and caveolae-independent entry pathways have been reported for SARS-CoV [21, 22] . Also feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was suggested to enter via a clathrin-and caveolaeindependent endocytic route [23, 24] . For the HCoV-229E a caveolae-dependent endocytic uptake has been suggested [25] . Although the ability of MHV S proteins to cause cell-cell fusion at a neutral pH was initially interpreted as an indication for fusion of virions at the cell surface, more recent studies indicate the requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis for entry of MHV [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, while some studies report that MHV strain A59 is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that affect endocytosis [26] , this is not the case according to others [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
