To this end, sucrose density gradient-purified MHV virus was covalently labeled with the low-pH resistant dye DyLight 488 (MHV-DL488). HeLa-mCC1a cells were transfected with plasmids to express monomeric RFP (mRFP) fusion proteins of RAB5, RAB7, or LAMP1. At 24 h post transfection, MHV-DL488 was bound to cells at 4uC for 90 min. Inoculation medium was replaced by warm medium containing trypan blue, which immediately shifts the emission spectrum of surface bound particles rendering them undetectable in the 505-530 nm channel unless they get endocytosed [65] . Cells were imaged using a spinning-disc confocal microscope acquiring zstacks in 30 s intervals over 10 min time frames from 10-70 min post warming. Only low-level RFP fusion protein expressing cells were selected for analysis. Interestingly, MHV particles newly appeared even 60 min post warming, in agreement with the notion that MHV enters in an unsynchronized manner (unpublished results). Co-localization and co-trafficking of viruses with endosomal compartments was assessed by detecting virus particles based on size and intensity (green channel) and by measuring the underlying intensity in the red channel (endosomal vesicles). MHV virions were found to co-localize with all three endosomal compartments (Fig. 4A ). Whereas newly entering/appearing particles were always co-localizing with RAB5 molecules, they only associated with RAB7 and LAMP1 containing vesicles at later time points.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
