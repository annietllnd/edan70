The fatality rate of MERS-CoV infection is approximately 35 .4%, and new cases as well as associated deaths continue to arise to date [9] . Despite that most cases have been attributed to human-to-human transmission, MERS-CoV does not appear to transmit efficiently among humans unless there is close contact. The exact source of MERS-CoV and its routes of transmission to humans still remain uncertain. Dromedary camels are believed to be the animal reservoir for MERS-CoV because isolates from camels are almost identical to those from human, and that many domestic camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV (reviewed in [10, 11] ). Furthermore, current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for MERS-CoV, as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV originate in bats, including BatCoV-HKU4, BatCoV-HKU5 and other MERS-related coronaviruses [12] [13] [14] [15] . The BatCoV-HKU4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of MERS-CoV, adding evidence to the bat origin theory [16] . However, there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating MERS-CoV from bats (reviewed in [10, 11, 17] ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
