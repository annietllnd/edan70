Combined pre-treatment with tulathromycin (1mg/mL; 1h) and PRRSV (m.o.i = 0.5) for 24 hours showed an additive effect to induce further MDMs apoptosis versus single treatments (Fig 8A) . To confirm these data, cells were stained with annexin V, a phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for the early apotptic marker phosphatidylserine (PS) [45] . At 24 hours, both tulathromycin alone or PRRSV alone induced significant levels of apoptosis compared to controls (4-fold increase vs. control) (Fig 8B and 8C) . When cells were exposed to the combination of tulathromycin Immuno-modulating properties of Tulathromycin in PRRSV-infected porcine monocyte-derived macrophages and PRRSV, levels of apotosis were almost double those measured in cells exposed to single treatments (Fig 8B and 8C ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
