JaOArS982-infected mice did not start to die until 13 days pi and the mean survival time (MST) was 15.5 ± 2.56 days ( Figure 1B ). Mice that died exhibited generalized clinical signs involving slowness in movement, ataxia, piloerection and anorexia. Continuous weight loss was observed in mice that died, whereas survivors regained weight from 13 to 15 days pi onwards ( Figure 1C ). On the other hand, JaTH160-infected mice started to die at 9 days pi and all mice had died by 15 days pi ( Figure 1B ) following continuous weight loss ( Figure 1C ). MST was 12.8 ± 0.89 days and was significantly shorter than that of JaOArS982-infected mice (Mann Whitney test, P=0.0173). Thus, we hypothesized that the cause of fatal disease was different between JaOArS982and JaTH160-infected mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
