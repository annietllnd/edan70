Of the HBoV1 single detection occurrences, a high viral load was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was a low viral load (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between the high viral load and low viral load group (Table 3) . We analyzed 18 HBoV1-positive patients who suffered from SRTI to study the association between HBoV1 and SRTI. Fourteen children had a diagnosis of severe pneumonia, 3 children had severe bronchiolitis, and 1 child had plastic bronchitis. Ten of 18 (55.6%) patients had a high HBoV1 load and only 3 of 10 children had other co-detected viruses, whereas 7 in 10 children with HBoV1 single detected were diagnosed with SRTI. The other 8 children who were diagnosed with SRTI had a low HBoV1 load. Among these 8 children, only 2 children were with HBoV1 single detected, whereas the other 6 children were co-detected with ADV, RSV or RV. HBoV1 single infection was more prevalent in the children with a high viral load than in those with a low viral load (70% vs. 25%) in the severe cases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
