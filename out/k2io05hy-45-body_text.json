Negative control wells, containing only dsRNA, also had OD values close to zero (figure 23). Wells containing biotinilated dsRNA and BTV NS4 were also negative, indicating that BTV NS4 does not bind dsRNA. However, the wells containing dsRNA and GIV NS4, had increasing OD values with an almost linear relationship between the fixed NS4 concentration (150 ng/well) and the increasing dsRNA concentration, reaching a plateau at 320 ng of dsRNA/well (figure 23). This confirms the existence of a dsRNAbinding domain in GIV NS4, which is absent from BTV NS4.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
