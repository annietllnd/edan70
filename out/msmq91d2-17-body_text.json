Briefly, 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with either MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs at a m.o.i of 3. Cells were treated with 0.5 mM 5-ethynyluridine (EU) from 12 to 13 hpi before harvesting at 13 hpi. As a control for transcriptional suppression, cells were treated with 5 mg/ml of ActD concurrently with the EU treatment. Incorporated EU was detected with an AlexaFluor 647-coupled azide (Invitrogen), and viral antigens were stained with anti-RVFV antibodies followed by an AlexaFluor 488-coupled secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on an LSRII Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
