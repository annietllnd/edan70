The pH was lowered (,pH 5.0) for 10 min before reneutralizing at 4uC to pH 7.2. At this point, the cells were in a ''cold-arrested'' stage (CAS). After 3 min, one of two operations was performed. In the first, 0.5 mM CPZ was added (through exchange of solutions at 4uC) and 1 min later the CPZ was washed out with a solution containing delipidated-BSA. Each dish was kept on ice, and each cover slip was removed to monitor aqueous dye transfer by fluorescence microscopy. In the second manipulation, cells at CAS were placed in a 37uC incubator for 30 min and dye transfer was then monitored. In order to make spontaneous monolayer curvatures more negative, 285 mM oleic acid (OA, Sigma) was incorporated into cell membranes either prior to or subsequent to creating CAS. For prior incorporations, effector and target cells were incubated together at room temperature for 20 min and OA was then added; 15 min later, the solutions were lowered to 4uC and CAS was created. OA was removed at 4uC by washing the cells with a solution containing delipidated-BSA. CPZ was then added or temperature was raised to 37uC. To incorporate OA subsequent to CAS, OA was added to cells at CAS, and CPZ was added or the temperature was raised without removing OA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
