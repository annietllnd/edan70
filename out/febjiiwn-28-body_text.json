Overall, no chronic infections of previously characterized honey bee viruses were observed and our data suggest that healthy colonies are undergoing constant cycles of viral infection. The most prevalent, previously characterized viruses in our study were BQCV, ABPV and SBV. The peak incidence of BQCV (25%) occurred in July, whereas ABPV (6.3%) and SBV (12.5%) peaked in August. Summer peak virus incidence was also reported in a PCR based honey bee virus (BQCV, ABPV, and SBV) survey of 36 geographically distributed apiaries in France (BQCV, ABPV, DWV, SBV, CBPV, KBV) [78] , a qPCR time-course study of 15 colonies in England (BQCV and ABPV) [60] , and an unpublished East-coast U.S. based survey (BQCV) [19] . Another virus, invertebrate iridescent virus-6, claimed to be associated with CCD and prevalent (75%) in healthy colonies but not supported in subsequent analysis [84, 85] , was never detected by the APM (n = 431), end-point PCR (n = 197), or in any of the 20 samples that were deep sequenced [86] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
