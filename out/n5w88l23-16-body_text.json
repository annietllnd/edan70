Table 2 shows that the addition of 1 mM CoCl 2 , ZnCl 2 , or MnCl 2 activated dihydropyrimidinase activity, and followed the order Co 2+ > Zn 2+ > Mn 2+ ; CdCl 2 , NiCl 2 , MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 were not useful. We also added 1 mM CoCl 2 , the best supplement, into the bacterial culture for dihydropyrimidinase expression, and the resultant dihydropyrimidinase was purified and analyzed. The specific activity of this dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil was 5.9 ± 0.4 μmol/mg/min, a value very similar to that of the Co 2+ -activated enzyme (5.8 ± 0.5 μmol/mg/min). Thus, dihydropyrimidinase (1 mM CoCl 2 supplemented into the bacterial culture) was used for all analyses in this study, unless explicitly stated otherwise.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
