Thus, the increased expression of Hsp70 could be one of the protective responses of the host cells to maintain proteostasis under the stress of viral infection (Xu et al., 2019) . Although the gene expression profile remains almost undisturbed in the cells expressing VP1, as a viral component, VP1 is very likely identified as a foreign protein by the host cell, which triggers the stress response including the increased expression of Hsp70. Moreover, the nuclear localization of VP1 might directly or indirectly influence the expression of limited genes including HSPA1A and HSPA1B. Although we show that the increased level of Hsp70 is likely due to the elevated phosphorylation level of HSF1, which directly promotes the transcription of Hsp70, it remains unknown how VP1 could impact the phosphorylation of HSF1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
