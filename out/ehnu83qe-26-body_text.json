When coupled with microfluidic technologies, BIE can greatly improve the throughput for CMV detection on one chip. The microarrays developed here have multiple cells immobilized with different ligands for different CMV antibody subtypes. Imaging ellipsometry is also suitable to high-throughput analysis. It can be used to visualize the variation in signal from all units of the microarray with high spatial resolution. Patient sample analysis results from one microarray can simultaneously be identified, and the data can be obtained in several seconds using an imaging ellipsometer. Presently, our method can provide simultaneous 48 reaction areas. With its enhanced throughput and lower cost, BIE may be used in clinical mass CMV screenings for healthy births in the future.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
