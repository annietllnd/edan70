RNA helicases demonstrate substantial conservation of essential functional motifs from the family of Walker motifs for NTP binding [40] and comprise viral sequences almost exclusively ( Figure 1A ,B). In RdRPs, the functional motifs are also well conserved. An exception is presented by RNA helicases of Circoviridae, where a critical lysine in motif A can be replaced by an arginine or a glutamine [41] . In the Cryspoviruses RdRPs, the functional motif F likewise contains a substitution of a lysine by a glycine, which may have an impact on the binding of the metal ions and, hence, modify the catalytic function of the enzyme [42] . However, judging from the genome composition, both proteins appear to be fully functional in their respective species. In the former case, a recombination event with a non-vertebrate-infecting virus can be suspected to have introduced this protein into vertebrate-infecting viruses [43] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
