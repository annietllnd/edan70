However, antigenic diversity and var gene switching have made unambiguous identification of the PfEMP1 molecules that are responsible for specific adhesion phenotypes difficult. A quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT PCR) method was developed to measure the amount of mRNA being transcribed from 59 different NF54/3D7 var genes simultaneously [18] . Using this approach, a particular PfEMP1, VAR2CSA, was identified as the parasite ligand likely to be responsible for CSA binding in the placenta [18, 19] . In another study using the same method, the group A var genes of 3D7 were associated with severe malaria [20, 21] . However, correlating expression of var genes to the phenotype of a parasite population can yield equivocal results, and studies on var gene transcription have given conflicting results regarding both the number of var genes being transcribed and the size of these transcripts. Two reverse transcription (RT)-PCR studies suggested that most or all var genes are transcribed in ring-stage parasites, whereas in mature trophozoites all but one var gene was silenced. Only the var gene actively transcribed in late stages would then be translated into protein to confer the phenotype [22, 23] . Other studies have proposed that multiple full-length var transcripts are present in ringstage parasites but not in mature stages, with the exception of the var1csa gene which was detectable in both trophozoites and later stages [24, 25] . A third group of studies detected multiple full-length transcripts in ring-stage and mature trophozoite parasites in both clonal populations [26] and in single cells [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
