These analyses also suggest that the NS4 may be functionally related to proteins involved in nucleic acid binding, or associated with lipids and membranes. Nuclear localisation signals were predicted in NS4 of PHSV, YUOV, EHDV, BTV, AHSV and GIV. All these proteins are rich in arginine and lysine residues that are essential for NLS [47] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
