Vaccination may compromise the identification of infected animals since both natural infection and vaccination induce antibodies specific to the pathogen. Therefore, new generation vaccines should have a marker to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which can cause hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans and a high-rate abortion in ruminants. MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is safe and immunogenic, but lacks a DIVA marker. In this study, we developed and characterized improved MP-12 viruses which encode a DIVA marker by replacing the virulence gene with that of serologically distinct viruses belonging to the same genera. The novel MP-12 variant with such DIVA marker was highly efficacious and replicated efficiently in human diploid cells for vaccine production, and will become alternative candidate vaccines of MP-12 for veterinary applications.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
