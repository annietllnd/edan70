To prepare the virus stock, monolayers of Vero cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of~0.1 and cultured in plain Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) at 37°C for 24 h. After three freeze/thaw cycles, cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was aliquot and stored at −80°C as virus stock. The titer of the virus stock was determined by plaque assays. Mock lysate was similarly prepared by subjecting uninfected Vero cells to three freeze/thaw cycles and clarified by centrifugation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
