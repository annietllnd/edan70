Initialization of the leftmost column is done by adding a column "0" to the left of the table, filling it with zeroes, and applying (2) to column k = 1. Once the table is filled, we perform a traceback operation, analogous to sequence alignment. It consists in concatenating the optimal quartets backwards, with the first nucleotide Q k (1) of the each optimal quartet serving as a pointer to the state  we should move to in the previous column. The cost of the whole procedure is proportional to the length N of the overlapping sequences. For the reading frames other than F = −2, the same method applies; only the positions of the X′ and Y′ codons within each quartet Q change, changing slightly the mechanics for calculating the score S(Q). This method leads to the sequences X′, Y′ that globally maximize the score S(X′, Y′).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
