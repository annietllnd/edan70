In the present study, we retrieved the dates of exposure and illness onset from this report. The date of exposure was calculable because many cases were associated with exposure at Yoyogi Park. Individuals who did not have a history of visiting Yoyogi Park had a history of being bitten by mosquitoes in one of several other parks in the nearby Kanto region. However, the date of exposure was partly censored. Of the total 160 reported cases, four were excluded owing to the absence of information about illness onset (i.e., people who were serologically diagnosed, including local residents of the park). The remaining reported cases were statistically categorized into one of the following three groups (Fig 1): 1. cases exposed to DENV on a single day with a known date of illness onset (i.e., complete observation; Group 1, n = 79), 2. cases exposed to DENV for a certain number of days with a known date of illness onset (i.e., interval-censored observation of exposure; Group 2, n = 47), 3 . cases without information of the date of exposure but with a known date of illness onset (i.e., missing observation of exposure; Group 3, n = 30).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
