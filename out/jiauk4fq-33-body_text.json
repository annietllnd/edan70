In healthy calves, septal MΦs presented a similar response after BHV-1 inoculation; although in these animals the decrease of this mediator was observed later than in the BVDV/BHV-1 group. On the contrary, the number of iNOS-positive PAM was higher in the BVDV/BHV-1 group and did not suffer changes throughout the study, while BHV-1 group calves showed a significant decrease from 7 dpi (Figure 7 ). Intracellular localization of COX-2 was perinuclear and cytoplasmic in the MΦs, being its expression scarce in the lungs during the study ( Figure 8C ), except for septal MΦs of the BVDV/BHV-1 group at 4 dpi (p < 0.0001) (Figure 7 ). This intense expression occurred at sites of inflammation and injury, mainly oedemas, and was correlated with the degree of pulmonary inflammation ( Figure 8D ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
