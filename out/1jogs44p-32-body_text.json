Importantly, LD patterns in these regions are population specific. In the CEACAM7-5-6 region, extensive LD was obvious only in CEU and ASN, but not YRI populations (Fig. S6a in File S1). At the PSG11-2-5-4 region, a unique pattern of LD was only shared by CEU and YRI populations (Fig. S6b in File S1). On the other hand, extensive LD at the CEACAM21-4 region was only found in ASN populations (Fig. S6c in File S1). ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
