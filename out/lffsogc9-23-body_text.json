Our findings also indicated that IBV has a broad range of hosts, opening more possibility of a spillover effect to happen on environmental contamination. This finding was in accordance with the previous study that isolated avian coronavirus in waterfowls and teal that did not show any symptoms of the disease [19, 21] . There is a possibility that wild birds and other non-galliform birds may harbor IBV or IB-like coronavirus without showing any symptoms and illustrate the wide host range of coronavirus.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
