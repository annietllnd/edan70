Histograms of E p values are shown in Fig. 4 . Summing over all three reading frames, we obtained an E p (X′, Y′) value of 10 −10 or better for 20,502 pairs, representing 16.3% of all pairs. For 12,162 pairs (9.7%) the E p (X′, Y′) value was 10 −15 or better. For pairs of non-viral proteins, the success rate (E p (X′, Y′) value of 10 −10 or better) was 14.1%. For pairs of viral proteins, it was especially high: 51.6%. None of the viral pairs were naturally-existing pairs. For viral/non-viral pairs, it was 26%. The success rate was best in the F = −2 frame and poorest in the F = 0 frame (7.4% of pairs with −log E p > 10), which both correspond to sense/antisense overlap. This was expected, given the structure of the genetic code and the relative importance of the central and wobble codon bases (see below). For the F = 1 sense:sense overlap scheme, the success rate was intermediate: 13.5% of pairs had −log E p > 10.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
