This was not always the target protein X or Y, but sometimes a natural homolog from the same Pfam family. The corresponding E-values for X′ and Y′ were compared, and the largest one, denoted E p (X′, Y′), was taken as the homology metric. For the longer protein, say Y, the non-overlapping part of the protein sequence was not included in the Blast query; only the overlapping sequence was employed. We only considered a Blast result if the match length was at least 85% of the length of the overlapping sequence region; all shorter Blast matches were discarded.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
