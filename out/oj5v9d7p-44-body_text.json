However, dietary inclusion of oridonin, a compound extracted from medicinal herbs, was able to ameliorate the aforementioned effects of LPS on the antioxidant enzymes and Nrf2 expression [277] . Lipopolysaccharide treatment was shown to significantly increase the expressions of Nrf2, Keap1, SOD1, SOD2, GPx and YAP1 genes in chick chorioallantoic membrane. Interestingly, addition of 400 or 800 Âµg/ml N-acetylcysteine suppressed the LPS-enhanced expressions of Nrf2, GPx and Keap1 genes [278] . It seems likely that, similar to other stress conditions, the response of Nrf2 can be up-or downregulated by LPS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
