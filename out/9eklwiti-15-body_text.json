However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are another testing modality which include standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that provide rapid, highly sensitive and specific results. Recent additions to the NAATs' diagnostic armamentarium include PCR with multiplex and real-time readings which have been FDA-approved for the diagnosis of LRTIs. These panels test a sample and obtain results within <5 h, reducing the time needed to confirm a causal pathogen for LRTIs. The Unyvero LRT cartridge, which was approved in 2018 by FDA, detects pathogens associated with >90% of pneumonia in hospitalized patients as well as genetic antibiotic resistance markers in endotracheal aspirate samples [57] . The LRT cartridge panel has a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 99.5% across all lower respiratory tract panel pathogens. It is a first-in-class molecular test for LRTIs and is the first automated molecular diagnostic test approved by FDA for Legionella pneumoniae. Future FDA approval is being sought for expanding the samples to include bronchoalveolar lavage aspirates and expand the assay to include Pneumocystis jirovecii. In addition, development of a smaller unit, Unyvero A30 RQ is in process with faster results (within 90 min) using real-time PCR.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
