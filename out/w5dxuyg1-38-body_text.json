Interestingly, when comparing natural and experimental FIP, the range of cytokine transcription extended higher in the natural cases. It is possible that the prior SPF status of the experimentally infected cats accounts for this as they would not have had previous exposure to FCoVs and/or other common infectious pathogens. They would also be at a more regulated stage of disease and received identical virus and dosage, likely explaining the lower variability of the results. This difference between groups, with higher levels in many of the natural cases, also supports the role of these organs in systemic inflammation generally rather than as a FCoV specific response.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
