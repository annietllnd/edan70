Unlike Ctype lectins, glycan binding by the CRD is independent of calcium binding. Galectin-1 has been shown to bind to the envelope fusion glycoprotein (F) of Nipah [294] [295] [296] , Hendra [294] , and HA of influenza [297] viruses and inhibit membrane fusion. However, galectin-1 has also been shown to promote HIV infection of T cells by cross-linking the virus to host cells [298, 299] . The varied pro-and anti-viral consequences of soluble lectin interactions highlights the diverse, at times, paradoxical roles that they play in the innate immune system.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
