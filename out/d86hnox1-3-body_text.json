In particular, a synthetic organism where several genes overlap would have fewer available neutral mutations, since each mutation in the overlapping region would affect more than one protein. Thus, the organism would undergo reduced genetic drift and remain closer to its original, designed genotype. An example of a designed overlapping gene was produced recently, where each DNA strand coded for a simplified but functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase "Urzyme" [13] [14] [15] [16] , with the two enzymes being homologous to the two modern synthetase classes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
