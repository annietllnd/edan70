We expressed IFITM1 in 293T/GFP effector cells, in HTX/LH2SN target cells (the stable cell lines described above), or in both, and compared their effects on JSRV Env-induced cell-cell fusion. Expressing IFITM1 in effector cells (Fig. 4D , column 3; Fig. 4E ) was as effective in reducing cell-cell fusion by JSRV Env as expressing IFITM1 in target cells (Fig. 4D, column 2; Fig. 4E ), and co-expressing IFITM1 in both effector and target cells enhanced this inhibitory effect (Fig. 4D , column 4; compare columns 2 and 3 with column 4; p,0.05 in both cases; Fig. 4E ). Thus, the inhibition of cell-cell fusion by IFITM1 is not specifically related to its expression in effector or target cells. This result suggests that IFITM proteins are unlikely to suppress cell-cell fusion by directly acting on specific viral fusion proteins or their corresponding receptors, but rather through a common physical mechanism(s) (see below).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
