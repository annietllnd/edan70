Only 20.0% of the participant believed that viruses do not cause RTI. A good percentage of respondents had good knowledge about the transmission of RTI. These results are in line with the findings from Tashani et al. [18] , where 58% of the pilgrims reported correct means of transmission. Contrary to the findings in this study about knowledge of RTIs, several studies reported a low level of knowledge about respiratory tract infections [15, 16] . The responses based on the transmission of RTIs through water is 39.1%, by sharing towels with an infected person is 51.6% and through the air is 85.3%. In addition, the high percentage related to knowledge demonstrates the consistency of theory-based approaches in changing human behavior through the information that is based on personal beliefs that could motivate or discourage behavior change towards better health [28] . Based on the data gathered from the questions on the risk of RTI infection, 43.1%, 65.3%, and 28.9% of pilgrims were unaware of smokers, diabetic patients, and those in crowded places, respectively, being at risk of contracting the infection. This is very crucial as these pilgrims are at risk and the tendency to get RTIs could be high if the participants have any comorbidity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
