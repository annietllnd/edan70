Each serotype can be divided into five to six genotypes. However, there is no standard genotyping classification [DENV-1, (Goncalvez et al., 2002) ; DENV-2, (Anez et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2013) ; DENV-3, (Lanciotti et al., 1994; Wittke et al., 2002; Klungthong et al., 2008) ; DENV-4, (Abubakar et al., 2002) ]. DENV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is âˆ¼11 kb in length and encodes a capsid protein (C), premembrane protein (prM), and envelope glycoprotein (E) in addition to seven non-structural proteins (NSs, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) . DENV infection causes dengue illness, which may range from dengue fever (a mild illness) to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (the severe forms of the illness) in addition to asymptomatic cases Abbreviations: DENV, Dengue virus; C, capsid protein; prM, premembrane protein; E, envelope glycoprotein; NS, nonstructural protein; NCBI, national center for biotechnology information; IASR, Infectious Agents Surveillance Report.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
