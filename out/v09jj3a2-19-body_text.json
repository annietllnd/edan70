All but one of the non-clinical staff cases became ill during the first apparent wave of the outbreak, which encompassed the period the index patient was an inpatient at Hospital A. Housekeepers and certain members of the kitchen staff had access to the index patient's room(s) during his stay, for purposes of cleaning and meal delivery. Overall, observed attack rates were highest among personnel with direct patient care responsibilities. Notably, however, nursing staff at Hospital A who were assigned to the operating Room (Op.Rm.)/intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly lower attack rates (7.1, p < 0.006) than did nurses in other staffing categories. Though mid-wives might not be anticipated under normal circumstances to have had opportunities for direct contact with the index patient, several women who had had complicated deliveries were hospitalized in the inpatient ward or ICU during the index patient's stay; two briefly shared a room with him.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
