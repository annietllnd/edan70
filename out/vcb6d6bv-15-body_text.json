In vivo, the process is facilitated by the translocon which exposes the nascent chain, whose fate has not been decided yet, to the hydrophobic membrane core. The correlation between the hydrophobicity scales obtained in vivo [14] and in vitro [46] reinforces the idea that recognition of TM segments by the translocon involves direct interaction between the segment to be inserted and the surrounding lipids. Partition from the translocon channel into the membrane will depend not only on the amino acid composition but also on the precise position of the residues within the hydrophobic segment, the TM segment orientation, and the length of the helix [14, 15, 47, 48] . Even amino acid residues flanking a putative TM domain could affect the insertion process due to their preference for the cytosolic or luminal side of the membrane [49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
