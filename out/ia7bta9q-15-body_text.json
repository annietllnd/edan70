The conformation of JEV MTase domain is largely consistent with the available MTase crystal structures from eight other flaviviruses (Fig. 3A) . Amongst all nine viral species, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), WNV, and JEV belong to the same group, and indeed their MTase structures exhibit highest similarity among all structures [20, 29] . The high degree of structural conservation also suggests that the MTase domain is quite rigid, not much affected by presence of its natural fusion partner RdRP.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
