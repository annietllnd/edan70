They deal with free radicals at the site of their production. Since the superoxide radical is the main radical in the biological system, its effective removal is a primary task of the first level of the antioxidant defence [93] . However, as a result of SOD action, H 2 O 2 is produced, which is mainly dealt with by GPx, which has been recently characterised in relation to poultry [205, 206] . Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant non-protein thiol in avian and mammalian cells controlling redox balance and signalling, regulating transcription factors and gene expression and many other important cellular pathways/processes including epigenetic mechanisms [207] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
