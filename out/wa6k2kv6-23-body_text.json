The incidence of FLU-positive specimens was high. This may reflect the possibility that our sample collection was biased towards patients exhibiting ILI, which is a clinical or symptomatic definition of influenza to identify potential influenza cases, in other word, influenza-like illness case-definition make influenza viruses as the virus most commonly detected [5, 18, 20, 21] . A study of human-to-swine transmission of pandemic influenza A virus concluded that the human ILI case definition has a high specificity and a low sensitivity for FLU-A [22] . Influenza viruses usually account for a much greater proportion of positive specimens of influenza-like illness in adults than other respiratory viruses during the peak seasons [23] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
