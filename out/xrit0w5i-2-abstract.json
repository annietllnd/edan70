HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-ɑ/β in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. Conclusions: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
