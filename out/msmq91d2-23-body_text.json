We attempted to select the phlebovirus NSs which can inhibit type-I IFN induction. Using reverse genetics for RVFV MP-12 strain, we recovered recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs of PTV Adames strain (rMP12-PTNSs) or SFSV (rMP12-SFSNSs) (Fig. 1A) . In VeroE6 cells, rMP12-PTNSs formed clear plaques similar to those of MP-12, while rMP12-SFSNSs formed turbid plaques similar to those of rMP12-C13type [51, 58] (Fig. 1B) . PTV Adames strain NSs [48] and SFSV NSs inhibit IFN-b gene [34] , while SFSV NSs does not promote the degradation of PKR [34] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
