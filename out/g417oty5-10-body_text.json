Respiratory syncytial virus, HAdV and human metapneumovirus were more common among children younger than 5 years of age than among older children 38 . Pediatric ARD, especially CAP, caused by HAdV infection has raised the public health concerns worldwide due to its high morbidity and mortality, especially in immunocompromised population. However, few large-scale epidemiologic and clinical data nationwide is currently available. In our study, the HAdV infection rate was 5.09% in pediatric inpatients and outpatients in Southern China, whereas it was 12%-20.1% in hospitalized children in China 42, 43 . The type distributions of HAdV in Southern and Northern China are completely different. In Southern China, most of HAdV-positive cases were caused by HAdV-3 (61.6%), followed by HAdV-7 (15.2%), which was similar with the previous study 43 . However, HAdV-7 (46.2%) dominated in Northern China 42 . In Southern China, the peak season of HAdV infection rates was summer, with the exception of 2010. This was consistent with the study in hospitalized children in Southern China during 2012-2013 43 , but it was different from Northern China (winter) 42 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
