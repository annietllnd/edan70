One part EBOV suspension (100 μL) was mixed with 100 μL of either 0.3 g/L BSA (clean conditions) or 3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes (dirty conditions) as the interfering substance. The virus-protein mixture was added to 8 parts (800 μL) of the 1:10 diluted test product, with the exception of 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser which was diluted to 1:100. After a contact time of 15 s, 600 μL of the test mixture for the 10 % PVP-I solution, 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub, and 3.2 % PVP-I/alcohol solution were added to 57.0 mL ice-cold medium resulting in a 1:96 dilution of the test product. For the 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser, 120 μL of the test mixture was added to 57.6 mL which corresponds to a 1:481 dilution. After dilution, the samples were added in 200 μL aliquots to microtitre plates (288 wells) containing the indicator cells in 100 μL cell culture medium. The cells were cultivated for an incubation period of 6 days, and inspected microscopically for virus foci (virus-induced changes in cell morphology) (Fig. 1) . The viral titre was calculated as follows:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
