Briefly, the cells were plated to a 12-well plate the day before transfection. For each well, 0.8 µg of plasmid DNA and 2 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 were each diluted with 100 µl of plain medium and incubated for 5 min. Then the diluted plasmid and transfection reagent were mixed by brief vortex and incubated for another 20 min. The H1299 cells were changed with 800 µl of medium containing 5% FBS and the transfection mixture was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 6-8 h before replacing with complete medium. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of 2 or were mock infected, and were continued to be incubated before being harvested for protein and/or RNA analysis at indicated time points.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
