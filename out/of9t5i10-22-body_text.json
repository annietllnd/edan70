This demonstrates an important functional requirement for TLR3 in the host response against rhinovirus infection, indicates that poly (IC) is not always a good model for studying the biology of live viral infections [30] and suggests that poly (IC) could be utilized therapeutically because of differences in mechanisms of action. The RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway is important in the induction of type I IFN following rhinovirus infection, however, rhinovirus is able to inhibit IPS-1 in order to evade this arm of the immune response [88] , Fig. (1) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
