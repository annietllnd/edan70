This resulting "cytokine storm" may lead to lung injury and multiple organ failure. Since the "cytokine storm" is mediated by a functional immune system, those with normal immune system functions are more susceptible to severe and adverse effects of infections by these strains, which include avian influenza H5N1. There are significant differences in cytokine responses between H5N1 (A/HK/483/97, A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04) and H1N1 influenza viruses, primarily in relation to TNF-, IFN-, IL-6, IP-10 and RANTES which are elevated post-infection (p.i.) in human type II pneumocytes, but significantly more so in H5N1 infected cells, with more recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) being more potent at inducing IP-10 [54] [55] [56] . Inactivation of the virus by UV irradiation prior to infection of alveolar epithelial cells abolished cytokine induction suggesting that virus replication was required for cytokine induction [55] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
