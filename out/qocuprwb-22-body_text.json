Cells were stained with a mixture of different fluorescentlabeled antibodies directed at surface phenotypic markers, CD45-FITC, F4/80-PE, NK1.1-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8-APC, CD19-Alexa Fluor 700, CD3e-eFluor 450 (Beckman Coulter) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The stained cells were analyzed by Galiosâ„¢ flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Leukocytes were recognized by characteristic size (forward scatter), granularity (side scatter) and CD45 expression. Thymocytes were recognized by their characteristic size and CD4 + CD8 + double positive cells were recognized by the expression of CD4 + and CD8 + .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
