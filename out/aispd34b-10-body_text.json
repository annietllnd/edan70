After 48 hours of culture, late-stage trophozoites and schizonts were further enriched on a MACS column to exclude any remaining ring stages, as previously described [31] . This resulted in a synchronous population of parasites with more than 99% late-stage trophozoites and schizonts. Timing of parasite reinvasion was deter-mined by counting the percentage of ring-stage parasites of 300 infected erythrocytes on thin smears stained by Giemsa ( Figure 2 ). For RNA extractions, each parasite line was cultured in 26 different culture flasks at 1% hematocrit (50 Î¼l packed red blood cells) with ~10% parasitaemia after reinvasion. This was done to minimize handling time of the parasite cultures at other time points than during harvesting. The culture was centrifuged and 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) was added to the pellet to preserve RNA. For flow cytometry assays eight different culture flasks were prepared for each isolate. Since separation of ring stages from uninfected erythrocytes is difficult, these cultures were prepared at 0.25% haematocrit with approximately 25% parasitaemia observed after reinvasion to allow for direct staining and flow cytometric analysis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
