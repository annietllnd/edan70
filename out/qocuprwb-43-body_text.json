However, the proportion of infiltrated cells involving leukocytes (CD45), T cells (CD3, CD4 or CD8), B cells (CD19), NK cells (NK1.1) and macrophages (F4/80) did not appear to differ significantly between TNF-α KO and WT mice ( Figure 6C ). These observations suggest that the increased levels of cytokines in TNF-α KO mice were due to qualitative differences of their expression in inflammatory cells, rather than quantitative increases of infiltrating cytokine producing cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
