Therefore, making the spontaneous curvature more negative should oppose the inhibitory actions of IFITMs and thereby promote hemifusion. We tested this by adding oleic acid (OA) to aqueous solutions for 15 min to allow them to incorporate into plasma membranes. We observed that creating CAS in the presence of OA led to more fusion both when adding CPZ (Fig. 7A , compare second columns with first columns in each cell line) and raising temperature ( ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
