High frequency of recombinations also contributes to occasional changes of biological properties and virulence level [6, 7] . The most striking example is a highly pathogenic Type 2 PRRSV variant with 30 aa discontinuous deletion within nsp2 protein that emerged in 2006 in China devastating swine industry in several Asian countries [8, 9] . Recent animal infection studies indicated that some East European strains of PRRSV Type 1 have been characterized by higher pathogenicity compared to the mild syndrome produced by infection with subtype 1 [10] [11] [12] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
