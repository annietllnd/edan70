The sera were treated with 20% kaolin suspension and 0Á5% rooster red blood cell (RBC) suspension to remove non-specific inhibitors and natural serum agglutinins. The initial serum dilution was 1:20 using PBS; then, each sample was diluted twofold to a final dilution of 1:640 in 96-well V-bottom plates. The HI antibody titer of each sample was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution in which no hemagglutination was observed. Samples with an HI titer ≥40 were considered to be positive. Titers were classified as follows: ≤20, negative; 40-80, low; 160-320, medium; and ≥640, high. Values were expressed by mean log 2 antibody titers. Means log 2 antibody titers are equivalent to HI titers: 4Á32 = 20; 5Á32 = 40; 6Á32 = 80; 7Á32 = 160; 8Á32 = 320; and 9Á32 = 640. A herd was considered positive when at least one of the animals was seropositive.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
