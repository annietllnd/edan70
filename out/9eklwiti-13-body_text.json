Initial inappropriate treatment has been identified as a risk factor which increases mortality rates in patients with HABP/VABP [34] . Therefore, other diagnostic methods have been evaluated and assist in providing timely diagnoses ( Table 2 ). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is another modality used to diagnose bacterial LRTIs [52] . Approximately one isolated single colony from a culture plate is analyzed by the MALDI-TOF MS automated workflow and results are available within a few minutes identifying the microorganism based on matching to a library of microorganisms. Two MALDI-TOF MS systems have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and include the Vitek MS from bioMÃ©rieux, Inc, which can identify 1046 species including mycobacteria, as well as the MALDI Biotyper CA System from Bruker Daltonics, Inc, which can identify 333 species or species groups representing over 424 bacteria and yeast species. The species identified are different between the systems [35, 36] . In a study comparing the two systems, both systems correctly identified over 85% of the strains tested (254 Gram-positive bacteria, 167 Gram-negative bacteria, 109 mycobacteria and aerobic actinomycetes and 112 yeasts and mold), which included microorganisms associated with LRTIs [53] . The MALDI Biotyper CA is a smaller desktop technology compared with the larger Vitek MS. The drawback of the MALDI-TOF MS technology is the potential for overdiagnosis, depending on the colonies that are selected for testing, and lack of ability to identify new pathogens.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
