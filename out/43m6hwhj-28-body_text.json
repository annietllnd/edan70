This observation may indicate the differences in the infection progress or some time shift in the course of infection. In both groups infected with subtype 2 strains, BOR and ILI Agranulocytes Adhesion and Diapedesis was the most significant up-regulated pathway, followed by Granulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis and Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling pathways. This result is not unexpected since an inflammatory response, induced by infection, triggers the movement of leukocytes into body tissue towards the invader. Interestingly, the results of IPA analysis were comparable between both groups, when only immunological processes were considered.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
