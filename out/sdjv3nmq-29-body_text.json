All cells were grown in a 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO 2 . Huh-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). In all the experiments, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium before infected with IBV at an MOI of~2 or incubated with equal volume of UV-IBV in serum-free medium. After 2 h of absorption, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated at 37°C before harvested.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
