Three minimal functional domains of VP40 are required for efficient VLP egress, including a membrane (M) binding region, a self-interaction (I) domain, and one or more late (L) domain motifs. The L-domain motifs hijack or recruit specific host cell proteins that facilitate or promote efficient virus-cell separation [3, 4, 6, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .
