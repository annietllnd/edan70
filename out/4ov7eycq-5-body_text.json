Tetherin is localized in lipid rafts at the cell surface and on intracellular membranes 16 . Tetherin inhibits the release of not only HIV-1 but also that of a wide variety of enveloped viruses including other retroviruses, herpesviruses, filoviruses, and arenaviruses [17] [18] [19] . Several lentiviral proteins have acquired the ability to antagonize the antiviral activity of tetherin; these include Vpu, Env, and Nef in the case of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, respectively. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the Vpu-mediated downregulation of tetherin. Vpu (i) removes tetherin from sites of virus budding, (ii) enhances degradation of tetherin, and (iii) down-regulates cell surface tetherin expression. The down regulation of cell surface tetherin by Vpu is in part due to slowing down the plasma membrane access of newly synthesized tetherin by trapping within the Golgi network. Vpu-induced downregulation of tetherin cell-surface expression is also associated with a ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation through the ESCRT machinery that involves the recruitment of the Î² -TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase (reviewed in 20, 21 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
