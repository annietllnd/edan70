In animal cells, components of the transcription and 3'-end processing machinery are localized in Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs), nuclear domains that assemble at histone gene loci and are present throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, histone gene expression is repressed during G1 phase and becomes activated only with the onset of S phase and DNA replication in response to cell cycle signals, including cyclin E/ CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT, a universal coactivator of histone gene expression [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . A growing body of evidence suggests that FLASH is targeted to HLBs as a separate entity rather than a subunit of the U7 snRNP. For example, mutations in either Lsm11 or FLASH that disrupt binding between their N-terminal domains do not affect localization of either FLASH or U7 snRNP to the Drosophila HLB, but abolishes processing in vivo [40, 41] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
