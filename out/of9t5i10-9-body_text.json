Influenza viruses are transmitted primarily through aerosol inhalation of contagious droplets generated by sneezing or coughing, or through direct contact with an infected person. Influenza pandemics occur when a novel strain of influenza virus causes a severe epidemic that spreads over several geographical locations and affects an exceptionally high proportion of the population in those locations. Past human influenza virus pandemics have been caused by influenza A H1N1 (1918-1920 and 2009 ), H2N2 (1957) (1958) (1959) (1960) and H3N2 (1968-1972) subtypes [36] . In recent years, highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses with subtypes H5N1, H6N1 [37] , H7N2 [38] , H7N3 [38, 39] , H7N7 [39] [40] [41] [42] and H9N2 [39, 43] have caused outbreaks in poultry in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America and all have pandemic potential [44, 45] . Fortunately the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain caused relatively mild disease in the majority of people infected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
