Interestingly, the levels of TNF-α and IL-2 in spleens were up-regulated in JaOArS982-infected mice at 5 and 9 days pi, however, they were not elevated in JaTH160-infected mice ( Figure S1B ). The levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 were not significantly different between JaOArS982 and JaTH160-infected mice ( Figure S1B ). These observations suggest that i) inflammatory responses in peripheral organs were different from those in the CNS, and ii) JaTH160 infection induced no significant expression of TNF-α in the spleen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
