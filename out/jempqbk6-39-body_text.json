Both parts have their limitations: on the one hand, only a fraction of viral proteins have a resolved three-dimensional structure; on the other hand, comparing protein structures allows for discovering remote homologies unrecognizable by sequence comparison. Naturally, the two parts complement each other in the analysis of certain proteins (Table 3) . A sequence comparison identifies all known members of each protein family, whereas structural comparison provides information on distant homologs and sometimes allows one to resolve evolutionary events. It must be noted that the number of resolved three-dimensional structures of viral proteins lags far behind the number of available sequences of them, and in the light of the new developments in the field of next-generation sequencing, this gap can be expected to be growing. Nevertheless, the information of the three-dimensional structures is essential to resolve distant homologies, as exemplified by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Table 3 .
