The results of RNA-seq demonstrate that the expression of Hsp70 was up-regulated in the cells overexpressing VP1. Since Hsp70, which is translated in 5 -cap independent mechanism, is also up-regulated in the cells infected with CVB3 , we presumed that the increased expression of Hsp70 could be responsible for the dysregulated cell cycle control proteins in the cells expressing VP1. And indeed, the dysregulated cyclin E and p27 Kip1 were related with the up-regulation of Hsp70 in the cells expressing VP1. Knockdown of Hsp70 with siRNA resulted in the accumulation of cyclin E and the reduction of p27 Kip1 . These data indicate that the up-regulated Hsp70 causes the decrease of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27 Kip1 , leading to G1 arrest.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
