Among those, the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS5 comprises an Nterminal methyltransferase (MTase) and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), playing key roles in processes including viral genome replication and capping. Although high-resolution crystal structures are available for MTase or RdRP alone, the intra-molecular interactions between the two modules remain elusive. By solving the crystal-structure of the full-length Japanese encephalitis virus NS5, we provide the first high-resolution readout of NS5 in its integrity, featuring an MTase-RdRP interface that is highly conserved in flaviviruses. Flaviviruses also include other important human pathogens such as dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, currently lacking effective anti-viral drug. The conserved interface revealed by our structure thus may provide possibilities for the pharmaceutical community in the development of anti-flavivirus drug in a broad-spectrum manner.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
