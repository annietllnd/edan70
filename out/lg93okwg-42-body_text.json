A final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of glutaraldehyde was added to 0.1 mg/mL (total volumẽ 100 μL) and 0.01 mg/mL (total volume~1 mL) of FLASH NTD C54S/C83A-Lsm11 NTD complex, FLASH NTD C54S/C83A, and FLASH NTD wildtype. Controls with protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL without glutaraldehyde were set up for each sample type. All samples were incubated at 37˚C for 3 min then chilled on ice. A final concentration of about 100 mM of Tris pH 8.0 was added into each sample to quench the cross-linking reaction. All samples were concentrated to a volume~20 μL using Sartorius Vivaspin 1 500 centrifugal concentrators with a molecular weight cut off of 10 kDa and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The speed of centrifugation for sedimentation equilibrium experiment (A) was 10,000 rpm (squares), 15,000 rpm (circles), and 25,000 rpm (triangles) at 20˚C each for 14 h. The velocity experiment (B) was 42,000 rpm (circles) at 20˚C for 6 h. The solid lines in two panels are the best fit results from global analysis of the two discrete species models by SEDPHAT (57) . The residuals of each fit are shown below the panels. The calculated sedimentation coefficients and M r from the best fit results are shown in Table 2 In the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex, FLASH NTD is the lower band (as it lacks a His tag compared to FLASH NTD alone), and Lsm11 NTD is the upper band. While the FLASH NTD band disappeared in the presence of glutaraldehyde, the Lsm11 NTD band mostly stayed the same. Therefore, probably very small amount of Lsm11 NTD (if any) got crosslinked in the reaction, consistent with the fact that it has only 1 Lys residue.
