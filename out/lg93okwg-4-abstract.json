The HCC is composed of a specific subset of proteins that also participate in cleavage and polyadenylation [23, 24], including the endonuclease CPSF-73, CPSF-100, symplekin and CstF-64 [1, [25][26][27]. Mutational studies on FLASH identified an LDLY motif (residues 55-58 in human FLASH, Fig 1B) as essential for binding the HCC, while residues 100-139 are involved in Lsm11 binding [22, 28].", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
