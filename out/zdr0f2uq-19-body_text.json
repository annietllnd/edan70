These NA-inhibitors are most commonly N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) derivatives, which competitively inhibit NA activity [104] . Additionally structure-based development of competitive inhibitors against the glycan binding sites of HN glycoproteins have been explored [102, 105] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
