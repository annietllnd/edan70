The formation of inter-helical electrostatic interactions requires that the implicated helices move from the translocon into the membrane after the interaction takes place and at the same time, in what is known as concerted insertion. During the biogenesis of multispanning membrane proteins once the first hydrophobic segment reaches the translocon it must be relocated to accommodate the following TM domains. There are at least two options: 1. Each hydrophobic segments leaves the translocon and partitions into the membrane individually [56] . 2. Two or more TM segments accumulate in the translocon or in its proximity and partition into the lipid core in block [57, 58] . It is thought that highly hydrophobic TM segments would leave the translocon individually, while less hydrophobic segments would need to interact with other helices in the translocon or its associated proteins before partitioning into the membrane [59] . In fact, interactions between TM segments with low hydrophobicity at early stages of the insertion process have been identified [60, 61] . Furthermore, marginally hydrophobic TM segments are retained in the translocon longer than highly hydrophobic TM domains [62] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
