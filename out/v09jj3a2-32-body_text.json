None of the four reported having had cough or fever, but two complained of diarrhea and another had a sore throat. A similar study conducted among health care workers in Singapore, revealed serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection in two workers (of 112 exposed individuals) who experienced only mild symptoms of illness [14] . Both of these individuals had had fever and multiple systemic or upper respiratory symptoms, but neither developed pneumonia.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
