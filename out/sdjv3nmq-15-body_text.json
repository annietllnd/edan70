H1299 cells transfected with siEGFP or siJNK were infected with IBV or mock infected. Both phos-JNK and total JNK levels were significantly reduced in siJNK-transfected cells compared with siEGFP control (Fig. 6a) . IBV-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun was also lower in JNK-knockdown cells compared with siEGFP control, suggesting a reduction of JNK activity. Notably, IBV-induced PARP cleavage in siEGFP control at 20 and 22 hpi, which was partially reduced in JNK-knockdown cells of the same time point. Interestingly, compared with mock-infected cells, Bcl2decreased during IBV infection in both siEGFP and siJNK-transfected cells. However, compared with siEGFP control of the same time point, a higher Bcl2 level was always detected in the JNKknockdown cells. JNK knockdown did not significantly affect IBV replication, as indicated by similar IBV N level compared to siEGFP control. Similarly, transfection of siJNKreduced phos-JNK and phos-c-Jun levels in IBVinfected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 6b) . Knockdown efficiency was lower in Huh-7 than in H1299, as considerable amount of phos-JNK and total JNK still remained detectable. Nonetheless, JNK knockdown still partially reduced IBVinduced PARP cleavage and modulated Bcl2, similar to what happened in H1299 cells. Thus, JNK-knockdown suppressed IBV-induced apoptosis, possibly by upregulating or stabilizing Bcl2.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
