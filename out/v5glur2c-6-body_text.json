One of the most serious complications for steroid administration is osteonecrosis (ON), that most frequently presents in femoral heads and often advances to subchondral bone collapse and needs arthroplasty [1] [2] [3] . However, there is a high failure rate in steroid-associated ON patients [4] . Prevention of ON is a very important strategy. However, the unclear pathogenesis of ON is still the stumbling block for developing effective prevention modalities.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
