The TMD1 Ϫ mutant retained IC activity, but the TMD2 Ϫ , TMD3 Ϫ , and TMD [2, 3] Ϫ variants did not, consistent with the importance of TMD2 and TMD3, as predicted by in silico models (54, 55) . To resolve the exact residues necessary for protein 3a IC activity, a complementary set of baculoviruses incorporating single amino acid substitutions within mutants TMD2 Ϫ (Y91A and H93A) and TMD3 Ϫ (Y109A, Y113A, and Q116A) was generated. These mutant proteins were expressed and purified, and their IC activity was evaluated. TMD2 point mutants Y91A and H93A and TMD3 point mutant Y109A completely abrogated protein 3a IC activity, whereas TMD3 point mutants Y113 and Q116 showed conductance that was equivalent to and only moderately decreased from that seen with the wt protein, respectively. Therefore, these results identified 3 amino acids that could be mutated to eliminate protein 3a IC activity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
