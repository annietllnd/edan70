Also the importance of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton -as demonstrated by the inhibition of MHV entry by downregulation of the Arp2/3 complex factors (ACTR2 and ACTR3), of the microtubule-associated transporter dynein (DYNC1H1 and DYNC2H1), or by addition of actin-or microtubule-affecting drugs -may be explained by the documented involvement of the cytoskeleton in endosome maturation (reviewed in [7] ). Indeed, entry of MHV-S29FCS, which presumably fuses in early endosomes, was much less affected by actin-affecting drugs than that of MHV carrying wild type spike proteins ( Figure S10 in Text S1). However, we cannot exclude that actin also plays a role in the clathrin-mediated uptake of MHV particles, as has been observed for VSV and other pathogens that depend on clathrin-mediated endocytosis (reviewed in [91] ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
