The first border is between the American continents and other regions (Figure 1B) , the second is located between Bangladesh and Myanmar for the genotype distributions of DENV-1 and -2 and India and Myanmar for DENV-3, and the third is located between Indochina and the Malay Peninsula (Figure 2) . There seem to be differences in the DENV-1 and -3 distributions between Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia; however, the border line is not clear because Malaysia and Indonesia consist of many islands and share Kalimantan Island and the deposited sequence data do not specify the original island isolation site. Although, some boundaries are not clear, these boundaries are roughly conserved among all serotypes except for the Bangladesh-Myanmar border line for DENV-4, suggesting potential barriers against the vector mosquitos' movements or human activities between the countries.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
