For each mutant, two independently generated BACs were analyzed (Fig. 10A) Collectively, these data strongly support the idea of the requirement of the PBM for viability of SARS-CoV (Fig. 10A ) and indicate that it was the E protein with a functional PBM that compensated for the loss of the full-length 3a protein. An additional mutant was generated in which the protein 3a PBM was mutated in the context of full-length E protein deletion [(3a-PBM Ϫ ,ΔE)], but the rescue of this virus was not possible (Fig. 10B) , again showing the necessity of at least one of the two proteins with a functional PBM for virus viability in the context of complete deletion of either the E gene or the 3a gene. Also, virus titers were significantly decreased after one passage for mutants Δ3a,EΔ1 and Δ3a,E-ΔPBM(rev) compared to the Δ3a virus (Fig. 10A ). In addition, Δ3a viruses with small deletions throughout the C terminus of E protein were not viable, possibly due to the requirement of the 3a protein native structure or of a length essential for PBM availability for binding to other viral or cellular proteins (Fig. 10A) . To analyze the relevance of protein shortening or folding, an additional mutant was constructed in the Δ3a background by filling in the EΔ4 deletion with an alanine-rich sequence in order to restore the original length or folding of the E protein [(Δ3a,EΔ4*)] (Fig. S2 ). This mutant virus was viable, indicating the lack of sequence specificity for the observed functionality. An alternative role for other domains located in the middle of the E protein C terminus cannot be completely ruled out.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
