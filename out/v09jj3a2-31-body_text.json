The potential benefits of enhanced infection control practices and barrier protections are also in evidence when looking at differences among workers at Hospital A who provided direct patient care. Among nurses at Hospital A, those who administered clinical care to critically ill or post-operative patients (Op.Rm./ICU nurses) experienced the lowest attack rates among all nursing categories, and though few (3 of 8) reported having engaged in any of the activities identified as being associated with risk for SARS-CoV infection (Table 3) , it is possible that the lower overall attack rate for this group of nurses reflects the fact that routine infection control precautions employed by Op.Rm./ICU to protect vulnerable patients in the ICU also provided these nurses with protection against exposure to SARS-CoV. Studies from other SARS outbreaks have shown that nurses charged with providing intensive care to patients experienced relatively fewer instances of SARS-CoV infection [5] , unless assisting with a high risk procedure such as an endotrachael intubation [12, 13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
