None of these samples was positive for the 3'-UTR of the avian coronavirus (UTR11âˆ’/41+). Three out of 10 swab samples were positive for the N gene coronavirus, but none of them was positive for the S1 IBV gene. However, four out of 10 samples of allantoic fluid tested were positive for the coronavirus N gene. Of the two that tested positive for the S1 gene of IBV, only one of them, which was designated as parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16, was able to be further sequenced. These results are presented in Table- 3.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
