Interestingly, the observed association between flavored milk and dental caries in this study could be a result of evolving trends in milk consumption practices in Saudi Arabia. Although prior observational studies [55, 56] contrast our findings, a moderate cariogenic potential of flavored milk observed in a recent animal experiment and the possibility of developing nations adopting this new trend warrant further evaluation [57] . Incidentally, our study contributed towards ever increasing evidence for the association between dental caries and sodas (or soft drinks) [58] [59] [60] . The acidic content of these soft drinks combined with sugars were known to reduce oral pH and increase the cariogenic potential of tooth [61] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
