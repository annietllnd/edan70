Several groups have reported mAbs isolated from either wild-type inbred mice or transgenic mice expressing human antibodyvariable heavy chains and Îº light chains. Mersmab-1 (known as hMS-1 after humanization) was isolated from mice immunized subcutaneously with chimeric S1-Fc [47, 48] . The mAbs 2E6 and 4C2 (humanized form 4C2 h) were isolated in mice immunized with recombinant RBD produced in insect cells [55] . Furthermore, two human-like mAbs, REGN3048 and REGN3051, were directly cloned from transgenic mice expressing human versions of the antibody after immunization with DNA encoding S glycoprotein and purified recombinant S glycoprotein [51] . Both mAbs have been tested in humanized mice models and in non-human primates [51, 52] . The authors indicated that the advantages of their system not only lay in the human component of their antibodies but also in the quick speed associated with isolation and production, since no humanization or optimization step was required. Currently, REGN3048 and REGN3051 have entered phase I clinical trials.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
