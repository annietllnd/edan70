Sera from mice injected intramuscularly with PBS, killed vaccine, AcHERV-HA, or AcHERV-VLP were collected and evaluated for immune response. (A) Antigen-specific IgG antibody titers against pH1N1 in mouse sera (on days 0, 7 and 21) were determined by ELISA. A450 refers absorbance at 450 nm. (B) HAI titer against the pH1N1 strain or PR8 strain in mouse sera on day 21. (C) Neutralizing titer against the pH1N1 strain or PR8 strain in mouse sera on day 21. ELISA and HAI assays were performed using ten randomly selected samples from each group (10/12). Neutralizing assays were performed using eight randomly selected samples from each group (8/12) . Values in parentheses indicate number of mice tested/total number of mice immunized in each group. All experiments were run in triplicate. The data shown are means ± SEM for samples. Statistical the titer of shed virus in the lung and assessed lung damage. Virus titer was determined by quantifying infection of MDCK cells, expressed as log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Virus titer in PBS-injected mice was 10 4.73 ± 0.22 , whereas that in mice immunized with killed vaccine or AcHERV-HA was 10 3.99 ± 0.23 and 10 4.08± 0.11 , respectively-approximately a 5-fold reduction in viral titer. Strikingly, the titer of shed viruses in mouse lungs in the group immunized with AcHERV-VLP was even lower (10 3.47 ± 0.21 )-an overall reduction in viral titer close to 20 fold (Table 1) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
