For example, group-housed calves on milk replacer with an automatic feeder fed 6 L will cost $3.50 per kg of gain. When these same calves are increased to 12 L the cost decreases to $2.67 per kg of gain. The minimum decrease in cost was from feeding 10 L of milk replacer to 12 L of milk replacer at $0.01 difference per kg of gain, and the maximum savings per kg of gain was $0.41 increasing from 10 to 12 L of pasteurized whole milk. If birth weights were 44 kg with a goal of weaning calves at 100 kg, we could assume a minimum of $0.56 to $22.96 in feed efficiency savings per calf alone. Modeling cost per kg of gain following experimental data presented in the (NRC, 2001) equations indicates that feeding calves a higher allowance of milk decreases the cost per kg of gain. The cost of milk and calf starter, with our current assumptions in inputs and ADG, decrease cost per kg of gain. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
