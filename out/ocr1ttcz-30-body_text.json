It has an extremely high level of gene expression as well as rapid and efficient replication 35, 51 . VSV-based vaccine is most feasible initially for controlling outbreaks of highly pathogenic agents in situations where the high risk of the pathogen would outweigh any potential side effects of the VSV vector. To date, VSV-based vaccine candidates have been developed for filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) [38] [39] [40] [41] 52 , arenaviruses (Lassa virus and LCMV) 53, 54 , henipaviruses (Nipah virus and Hendra virus) 55, 56 , and human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) 57, 58 . A single dose of these rVSV-based vaccines has been shown to highly effective in small animal models as well as nonhuman primates when 35 . We now added the rVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidate to this list.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
