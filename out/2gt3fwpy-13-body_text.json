A control group was vaccinated with 10 7 pfu of MVA. Seven (7) days after vaccination, mice were euthanized, spleens were collected from dissected mice, and lymphocytes were isolated from spleen homogenates as previously described [51] . Spleen cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and re-stimulated with live HSV-2 (strain MS) at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. Culture supernatants were harvested after 48 hours, clarified of cells by centrifugation, and tested for IL-2 and IFN-Î³ by capture ELISA as described [51] , and reagents obtained from BD Pharmingen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
