To investigate whether endogenous SGTA plays a role in HIV-1 release, we carried out knockdown experiments in HeLa cells. We used single or pooled siRNAs from three different sources (Sigma, Ambion, and Qiagen). An SGTA knockdown efficiency of up to 80% was achieved (Fig. 1A,C) . Under these conditions, there was no significant effect on virus release for HIV-1 molecular clones either expressing (WT) or not expressing (delVpu) the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu (Fig. 1A,B) . The Scientific RepoRts | 6:24934 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24934 knockdown of SGTA also had little or no effect on the expression of tetherin and no obvious toxicity to the cells was observed as determined by unchanged levels of tubulin expression (Fig. 1A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
