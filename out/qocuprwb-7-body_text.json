Flavivirus variants may induce different degrees of pathology, however, the host immune response is likely to be a more critical determinant of clinical outcome [19] . Inflammatory responses mainly contribute to virus clearance and recovery from fatal disease. For example, CD8 + T cells are reported to have an important function in controlling virus infection [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , although one report showed only a subsidiary contribution of CD8 + T cells in JEV infection [26] . On the other hand, in recent studies it was suggested that immunopathological mechanisms may contribute to the severity of outcome following some encephalitic flavivirus infections [19, [27] [28] [29] [30] . For example, it was reported that CD8 + T cell function enhances pathogenicity during WNV and MVEV infections [29, 30] . Furthermore, in Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)-infected mice the inflammatory response was reported to contribute significantly to the fatal outcome [28] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
