The induction of ER stress and UPR during coronavirus infection. Coronavirus infection induces ER stress and activates UPR. Activated ATF6 transcriptionally induces XBP1, ER chaperones and enzymes to enhance the ER folding capacity. Activated IRE1 mediates splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, whereas the spliced XBP1 protein enhances ER folding and reduces ER burden by promoting ERAD. Activated PERK mediates the phosphorylation of eIF2Î±, leading to a global translation attenuation. Signaling via the ATF4-CHOP pathway promotes apoptosis induction during prolonged ER stress. The known coronaviruses and viral proteins modulating the UPR signaling are also indicated. Green arrows are activating and red blunt arrows are inhibiting.
