Briefly, array oligonucleotides were selected for uniqueness against an insect nucleic acid background, for ,50% GC content to maintain high complexity, and for cross-reactivity of highly-conserved nucleic acid features with evolutionarily related targets (,250 kcal/mol predicted binding energy). Arthropod pathogen oligonucleotides (GEO GPL11490) were synthesized by Invitrogen, suspended at 40 pmol/mL in 36 SSC and 0.4 pmol/mL control oligo and printed on poly-L-lysine slides (Thermo) with silicon pins as previously described [100] . Each oligonucleotide and its reverse complement were printed twice for redundancy. Arrays were allowed to air-dry and stored and room temperature. Prior to use, oligonucelotides were cross-linked to slides via UV exposure (600 mJ), washed with 36SSC/0.2% SDS and blocked using a methylpyrrolidone solution (335 mL 1methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 5.5 grams succinic anhydride, 15 mL 1 M sodium borate).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
