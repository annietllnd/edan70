All vaccine immunization groups (except PBS controls) showed HAI antibody titers > 1:32 against the homologous pH1N1; as expected, immunization with AcHERV-VLP enhanced HAI antibody responses (~3.9-fold) compared with immunization with AcHERV-HA ( Fig 3B) . Interestingly, only AcHERV-VLPimmunized mice showed high HAI responses (>1:32) against intrasubgroup H1 strain (Fig 3B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
