For two classes of structural proteins and four classes of enzymes, we observe structural similarities between proteins of viruses from different Baltimore classes (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4 ). Analyzing the spread of the respective proteins in the corresponding viral families, one can again observe two patterns: some proteins can be found in many viral families and ubiquitous within these families, and others are found in typically two families from different Baltimore classes and even within them are confined to a few genera. In the absence of the possibility of conducting a proper evolutionary analysis of the respective protein clusters due to the virtual lack of sequence similarity, we refrain here from calling them "families" and refer to these two groups as widely populated and confined folds, respectively.
