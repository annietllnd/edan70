Accordingly, the NLRP3 inflammasome is usually associated with sensing cytosolic danger signals referred to as DAMPs. Not only intact viruses, such as IAV, SeV, HSV, and adenovirus (AdV), but also viral components, including internalized or genomic DNA, dsRNA, ssRNA, and even poly(I:C), could directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce IL-1Î² secretion in macrophages (5, 28, (41) (42) (43) . During infection, viruses cause a series of changes in cellular status of their host cells, including lysosomal maturation, aberrant ion concentrations, mitochondria damage, and the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, all of which are recognized as danger signals by the host and lead to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
