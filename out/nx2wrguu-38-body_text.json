Because the anticipated number of generations of infection was limited, and also because we sought to conduct careful evaluation of the causal association between the timing of interventions and the effective reproduction number R t , we did not use the structured compartmental modeling approach (e.g., using ordinary differential equations). Instead, we developed a novel method to directly parameterize the incidence of infection, by convoluting the incidence of infection with the incubation period, allowing us to precisely incorporate the timing of interventions and observe their effect on virus transmission dynamics on a given day. The proposed method suitable for application (i) when the generation structure is imaginable from a published estimate of the mean generation time or visually identifiable from the observed epidemic curve, (ii) when the time of infection needs to be modeled in relation to the timing of interventions, and (iii) when the observed data include doubly intervalcensored data. As a consequence of our analyses, the effectiveness of mosquito control, dengue risk communication to elevate public awareness, and closure of the focal area of transmission were objectively evaluated in relation to the effective reproduction number of DENV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
