Invertebrate virus-related contig sequences mostly related to the Nodaviridae, Baculoviridae and Dicistroviridae families, whereas the sequences related to viruses infecting plants were mostly associated with Phycodnaviridae, Tombusviridae or Luteoviridae, and those related to viruses infected protozoa were mostly associated with the family Mimiviridae ( Fig. 1B  and 2B ). There was a large proportion of phage-related contigs and reads, which displayed similarities to sequences from myoviruses, podoviruses and siphoviruses.
