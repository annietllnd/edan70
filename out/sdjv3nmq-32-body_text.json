The MKK7-3E mutant was generated by replacing amino acids serine 271, threonine 275, and serine 277 with glutamic acid using forward primer 5′-GAGAAAGCCAAGGAGCGGGAAGCCGGCTGTGC CGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTCCCGCTCCTTGG CTTTCTCGTCCACCAGGCGGCC-3′. The MKK7-3A mutant was generated by replacing the same sites with alanine using forward primer 5′-GCCAAAGC-CAAGGCGCGGGCCGCCGGCTGTGCCGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCCCGCGCCTTGGCTTTGG CGTCCACCAGGCGGCC. The serine 70 in pXJ40-FLAG-Bcl2 was replaced with alanine using forward primer 5′-GTCGCCAGGACCGCGCCGCTGCAGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCTGCAGCGGCGCGGT CCTGGCGAC-3′ to generate the Bcl2-S70A mutant. The constructs pcDNA-FLAG-MKK7-JNK1 and pcDNA-FLAG-MKK7-JNK1(APF) were obtained from Addgene as previously descried 29 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
