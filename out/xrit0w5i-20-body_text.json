Supernatant in each group was collected at 6, 12 and 24 h postinfection for ELISA assay. Results showed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05, ANOVA) between treated and untreated control group at each time point in HUVECs (Fig. 2a, b) , suggesting that interferon-α/β did not participate in the induction of IFITM1 in HUVECs. However, different results were observed in BEAS-2Bs. Compare to control group, levels of interferon-α/β were significantly upregulated at 6, 12 and 24 h postinfection (P < 0.05, ANOVA), viral particle inoculation just induced a higher level of interferon-α (P < 0.05, ANOVA) at 6 h (Fig. 2c, d) . In addition, H9N2 virus infection also induced higher levels of interferonα/β than that induced by viral particle inoculation in BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 2c, d) . The results demonstrated that H9N2 virus and viral particle might share different mechanisms in the induction of IFITM1 expression in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
