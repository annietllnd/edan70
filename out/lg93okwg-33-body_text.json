The sitting drops were set up by mixing 1 μL of 4 mg/mL selenomethionyl FLASH NTD or 5 mg/mL FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant protein with 1 μL of well solution. The well solution for selenomethionyl FLASH NTD crystals contained 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 18% (w/v) PEG 4000; for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A crystal form 1, 4% (w/v) tacsimate pH 7.0, 11% (w/v) PEG 3350; and for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A crystal form 2, 100 mM sodium formate, 15% (w/v) PEG 3350, 3% (v/v) 1,6-hexanediol. The crystals were harvested and soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 15% (v/v) (selenomethionyl FLASH NTD) or 20% (v/v) (FLASH NTD C54S/C83A) ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
