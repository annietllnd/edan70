An activation of this pathway was observed previously in the transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs after PRRSV vaccination [81] . Particularly interesting results were described for CCL4 cytokine (MIP-1β), recently investigated in several PRRSV studies. Miller et al. [82] and López-Fuertes et al. [83] observed that the level of transcripts encoding CCL4 declined in porcine alveolar macrophages following infection with both Type 2 strain VR-2332 and European Type 1 PRRSV isolate 5710. In our study we observed the opposite effect and up-regulated expression of CCL-4 in BOR (FC = 2.5) and ILI (FC = 1.8) groups. The same additive effect for this inflammatory mediator was noted in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV (IAF-Klop PRRSV genotype 2 strain) after a subsequent infection with S. suis (wild-type virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7) [84] . CCL-4 is considered as the most potent chemoattractant and mediator of virus-induced inflammation in vivo [85] , thus acitivation of Chemokine Signaling pathway and up-regulation of CCL-4 can contribute to the higher virulence of BOR and ILI strains compared to DAN observed in an animal experiment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
