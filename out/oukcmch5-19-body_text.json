A virion was categorized as associating with a certain endosomal marker only if this co-localization was observed over at least four sequential 30 s interval images. When the initial co-localization was lost, but the virion did not disappear, this virion was classified as associating/dissociating. Complete disappearance of a virus particle (including in other z-stacks) while immediately previously co-localizing with an endosomal marker was categorized as a fusion event (Figures S3 and S4 in Text S1). When a viral particle co-localized with endosomal compartments but did neither dissociate nor fade during the 10 min acquisition period it was classified as non-fusing. With this quantification method we analyzed 75-100 virions in total for each of the endosomal compartment types studied. The fraction of virions not fusing during the acquisition period was consistently found to be at around 10-15%. We observed that all of the entering MHV particles initially co-localized with RAB5-positive early endosomal vesicles and that most virions dissociated (were no longer colocalized) after 4-6 min. Notably, it appeared that in these events the RAB5 marker faded rather than moved away. Only a very small percentage of virions were categorized as fusing while in early endosomes. The number of fusion events was much higher for virions co-localizing with RAB7 or LAMP1 ( Figure 4B ), indicating that most virions fuse in late endosomes or lysosomes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
