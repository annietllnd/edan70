Mature Env exists as a trimer of non-covalently associated gp120-gp41 heterodimers that are generated by furin cleavage of a gp160 polypeptide precursor [147] . The gp120 receptor binding subunit helps dictate host cell tropism and facilitate attachment to CD4 receptor and CXCR4/ CCR5 co-receptors, while gp41 facilitates viral and host cell membrane fusion upon receptor binding by gp120, and the extensive conformational changes of Env that follow. HIV-1 Env presents between 18-33 glycans per gp120 monomer, with a median of 25 glycan sites on gp120 and 4 glycans on the gp41 subunit [23] . The extent of these posttranslational modifications, combined with the intrinsic flexibility of the trimeric Env [148, 149] and constant evolution of the glycan shield, renders HIV-1 Env an immunologically challenging target [150, 151] . The result of the dense glycosylation on the viral protein surface leads to the formation of the so-called intrinsic and trimer associated mannose-patches (IMP and TAMP, respectively) [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] , which arise due to the steric blocking of glycan-processing enzyme in the ER and Golgi apparatus by neighbouring glycans [157] . These often under-processed glycans are weakly immunogenic, since they are produced by the hostprocessing pathway, thereby limiting the response to deviating glycosylation [158] . Astoundingly, in the case of HIV-1, the conservation of these under-processed glycans can result in the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) that actually target these immunoquiescent host-derived glycans as part of their epitope [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] . As more bnAbs have been discovered, it has become clear that they can not only recognise the viral mannose patches, but some have also evolved to recognise complex and hybrid-type glycans [165] . However, the observation that bnAbs only develop in a subset of patients, and only after several years, underscores the fact that the glycan shield of HIV-1 has evolved under sustained immunological pressure, and represents an extreme challenge for the immune system and an important consideration in vaccination strategies [146, 159, [166] [167] [168] [169] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
