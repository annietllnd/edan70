Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding JSRV Env and/or IFITMs by the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved in DMEM without cysteine and methinonine (MP Biomedicals, Cost Mesa, CA) for 30 min and pulse-labeled with a 62.5 mCi mixture of cysteine plus methionine (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, WA) for 1 h, followed by chase-labeling in complete growth medium. To examine shedding of JSRV SU, 3 h after the chase period, indicated amounts of sHyal2 were added and cells were incubated for another 3 h. Cell lysates and culture media containing the 35 Slabeled JSRV Env were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. Samples were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and applied to autoradiography. Band intensities were quantified using Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
