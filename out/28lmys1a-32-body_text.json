Milk and calf starter contributed over half the cost to raise a calf from birth to weaning. Costs calculated by this model are based on currently available data; it is likely some of our assumptions will under or overestimate total and specific costs of calf raising practices across the US. More data are needed to improve accurate assumptions for farms. However, no model will be able to accurately describe all situations of calf rearing in various locations. Calculating pre-weaning cost for each individual farm is critical in making management decisions and remaining sustainable.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
