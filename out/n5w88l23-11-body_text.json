Dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were used as substrates. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, dihydrouracil (2 mM) was used as the substrate in the standard assay of dihydropyrimidinase. Briefly, the decrease in absorbancy at 230, 248, and 298 nm was measured upon hydrolysis of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide as the substrate at 25°C, respectively. To start the reaction, the purified dihydropyrimidinase (10-70 μg) was added to a 2 mL solution containing the substrate and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U 3300, Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The extinction coefficient of each substrate was determined experimentally by direct measurement with a spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficients of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were 0.683 mM -1 cm -1 at 230 nm, 0.0538 mM -1 cm -1 at 248 nm, and 3.12 mM -1 cm -1 at 298 nm, respectively. The initial rates of change were a function of enzyme concentration within the absorbance range of 0.01-0.18 min -1 . A unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol substrate/min, and the specific activity was expressed in terms of units of activity per milligram of enzyme. The kinetic parameters K m and V max were determined from a non-linear plot by fitting the hydrolyzing rate from individual experiments to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Enzyme Kinetics module of Sigma-Plot; Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA).
