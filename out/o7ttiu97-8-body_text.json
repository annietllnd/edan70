Body weight showed a drop on day 2 where the weight remained for the remainder of the study. Figure 1B shows the average temperatures of the mock-and KY/ 180-infected ferrets for the first 10 DPI. Temperature peaked on days 1 and 5 for KY/180 infected animals with a mean temperature of 103.4uF (SD = 1.71uF) and 103.2uF (SD = 0.52uF), respectively. The average hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) serum antibody titer in the blood on day 14 was 540 (reciprocal dilution) and the average total serum influenza-specific IgG by ELISA was 7610 (reciprocal dilution) (Fig. 1C) . In studies to determine the infectious dose, additional tissues were taken from animals infected at with KY/180 with a 0.5 ml dose of 0.5610 4.7 TCID 50 per naris. On day 2, viral titers were the highest in the nasal turbinates (10 6.25 TCID 50 /g) followed by the caudal lung (10 6.0 TCID 50 /g) and trachea (10 3.75 TCID 50 /g). The lowest levels of virus were observed in the cranial lobe of the lung (10 3.2 TCID 50 /g). Viral titers were measured by TCID 50 in nasal turbinates, trachea, right cranial lobe of the lung, right caudal lobe, brain, liver, spleen, kidney, duodenum, jejunoilieum, colon and rectum. KY/180 was detected in jejunum in one animal (10 2.0 TCID 50 /g), but was not detected in any other tissues (data not shown).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
