All of these enzymes have an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Thus, we extend the set of related RdRPs identified by sequence comparison. No structural homologs of RdRPs have been found among the proteins from cellular organisms, in agreement with their unique function in RNA viruses. Here, we show that sequence-structure homology spans all classes of RNA viruses. RdRPs from dsRNA and positive-strand ssRNA viruses have previously been reported to be related [67] . Now with resolved three-dimensional structures of RdRPs from negative-strand ssRNA viruses emerging [68] , one can argue that RdRPs from RNA viruses share a common fold. This agrees with an earlier hypothesis that negative-strand ssRNA RdRPs evolved from positive-strand ssRNA virus RdRPs [7] . RdRPs from Eukaryota have been reported, but they are structurally distinct, showing more similarity to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases [69] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
