Of the 12 strains tested (Fig. 2 ), HNIgGA6 only failed to bind to the HA1 of H7N9-SH1, whereas it bound the other 11 strains with a high affinity (K D values from 1.1e−10 to 6.39e−11 M). Thus, the mAb HNIgGA6 presents strikingly strong, broad binding activity, suggesting it has a broad neutralizing activity against divergent H7N9 strains.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
