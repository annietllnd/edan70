Of the mixed detection cases, the most frequently found concurrent co-detection with HBoV1 were RV (in 37 children), followed by ADV (in 16 children) and RSV (in 13 children). When the clinical symptoms and severity were compared, no difference was found between HBoV1 single detection and codetection (data not shown). In the high viral load group, 71.8% of the RTI patients were detected as having HBoV1 single detection whereas 28.2% of the patients had HBoV1 co-detection with another virus. In the low viral load group, 43.2% of the patients had HBoV1 single detection, and 56.8% of the cases were HBoV1 co-detection with another virus. When compared with HBoV1-negative persons, there was a significant difference between the patients with HBoV1 single detection and the codetection group at an HBoV1 high viral load with P = 0.017 (Table 2 ). These results indicated that HBoV1 at a high viral load was not frequently co-detection with other respiratory viruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
