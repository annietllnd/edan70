These methods form the basis for improved virus discovery processes capable of generating 10e5-10e7 sequence reads directly from a clinical sample. A virus discovery method to amplify RNA and DNA virus sequences directly in patient material (VIDISCA-454) without prior knowledge of the viral genome sequence has been developed [5] . The resulting DNA library is then subjected to Roche-454 next generation sequencing and this method has been successfully used to identify human coronavirus NL63 [6] , a novel HIV-1 subtype [7] , and 2 novel parvoviruses in bats [8] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
