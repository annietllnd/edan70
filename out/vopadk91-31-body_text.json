These studies have also been performed in the context of the infection but without the use of subcellular compartment markers, leading to the observation that protein 3a was located in the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus (27) . After our analysis in the context of the infection using markers for cellular compartments, we could not conclude that the SARS-CoV 3a protein is located in any of the previously described compartments. Furthermore, knowledge of the cellular location in which the 3a protein accumulates remained elusive after our analysis performed using markers for the following different intracellular compartments: ER, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
