Treatment with vaccine plus poly (IC) rapidly up-regulated TLR3 expression in the nasalassociated lymphoid tissue, up-regulated IL-4 and IL-12p40, and induced IFN-, -and - [108] . When mice were subsequently challenged with influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), cross-protection, partial protection or no protection was observed in those immunized with various H1N1 virus vaccines (A/PR/8, A/Beijing, A/Yamagata), heterologous influenza A vaccines (A/Guizhou -H3N2) or influenza B vaccines (B/Ibaraki, B/Yamagata, B/Aichi), respectively [109] . T-cell activation and increased IFN-production was observed only in mice immunized with homologous antigens [108] . Poly (ICLC) has been shown to be an effective adjuvant when co-administered with retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite [110] , chloroquine (for Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infections) [111] , anti-Semliki Forest virus hyperimmune serum [112] and IFN-/ (inhibited flavivirus replication) [113] . For clinical use, poly (IC) may be one of the most appropriate agents to generate stable mature DCs. These mature DCs might generate in vivo effective immune responses after injection, because they retain the ability to secrete bioactive IL-12 after CD40 ligation [114] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
