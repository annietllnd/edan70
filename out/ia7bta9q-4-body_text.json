NS5 has also been documented to interact with other viral replication proteins including the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) protease/ helicase, and to recruit promoter-like element stem loop A (SLA) in the 59 region of the viral genome for precise initiation of RNA synthesis [14] . Moreover, NS5 is involved in the importin-mediated nuclear import and exportin CRM1-mediated nuclear export, through its nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export sequence (NES), respectively [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, the understanding of these NS5-related molecular interactions is greatly hindered by the lacking of a crystal structure of the full-length protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
