The model of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase was built using human dihydropyrimidinase (PDB entry: 2VR2) as a template by SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel. expasy.org) [34] and (PS) 2 (http://140.113.239.111/~ps2v2/docs.php) [35] . The coordinate and topology file of the flavonoids was found in DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/) [36] . Myricetin and dihydromyricetin were computationally docked into the three-dimensional model of dihydropyrimidinase by using PatchDock (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/) [37] . The dihydrouracil-complexed structure model of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase was directly constructed by superimposing the crystal structure of the dihydrouracil-yeast dihydropyrimidinase complex (the coordinate of 2FVK). The structures were visualized by using the program PyMol.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
