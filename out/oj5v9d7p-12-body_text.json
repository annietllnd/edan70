The NF-E2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/inhibitory κB protein (NF-κB/IkB) systems were considered to be two major "master regulators" of the stress response. In particular, in stress conditions, both transcription factors are shown to be translocated to the nucleus, bound to appropriate DNA sites to provide protection, but in many cases with opposite effects. In general, the stress response is a quite complex process associated with various important biochemical and physiological pathways including the heat shock response, the unfolded protein response, the hypoxia induced response, and various repair mechanisms/programs. Furthermore, autophagy, mitophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, etc., are also deeply involved in homeostasis maintenance [99] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
