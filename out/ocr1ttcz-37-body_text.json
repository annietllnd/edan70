Viral RNA was extracted from recombinant VSVs by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ZIKV genes were amplified by a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using primers annealing to VSV G gene at position 4524 (5′-CGAGTTGGTATTTATCTTTGC-3′) and L gene at position 4831 (5′-GTACGTCATGCGCTCATCG-3′) (numbering refers to the complete VSV Indiana genome sequence). The amplified products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
