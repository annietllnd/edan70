Absorbance was measured using a SpectraMax M2e microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) set at 405nm. MDMs were incubated with tulathromycin (0.5 or 1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes and infected with PRRSV (m.o.i. of 0.1) for 2, 12 or 24h at 37˚C, 5% CO 2 . Similar experimental treatments were conducted with cells stimulated with LPS (1μg/mL from E. coli O26:B6; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) to assess apoptosis in activated macrophages. For all experiments, cells incubated with IMDM containing 10% HI-pig serum or staurosporine (1μM) were used as negative and positive controls respectively. Annexin V staining (Roche) was performed on the same experimental groups to further assess apoptotic cell death. Staining was performed as per manufacturer's instructions and fluorescence was observed using a Leica DMR fluorescent microscope equipped with a HCX PL FLUOTAR x40 objective (aperture = 0.75). Images were taken at 2, 12 and 24 hours post infection (p. i) with a Retiga 2000x (Q imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). Importantly, experiments measuring cytokines and ROS followed those in which we measured apoptosis. This allowed to adjust concentrations of tulathromycin and virus to levels at which apoptosis was not detected in the cells, and hence cell death would not be a factor in the cellular cytokine and ROS responses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
