Whether these paradoxical consequences are due to lectin functions to tackle non-viral pathogens such as fungi and bacteria, it would seem likely that immune cells exhibiting these lectins, [242] . (B) The collagen-containing C-type lectin, mannose binding lectin (MBL), that recognises oligomannose-type glycans via a carbohydrate recognition domain containing a calcium ion (pink), which is responsible for mediating the primary interactions to bind the sugar (PDB ID: 1KX1) [243] . (C) The membrane bound C-type lectin receptor, DC-SIGN recognises oligomannose-type glycans via a Ca 2+ ion and initiates phagocytosis of the pathogen (PDB ID: 1SL4) [216] . (D) An anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralising antibody, PGT128, that recognises conserved oligomannosetype glycans on Env using an extended complementarity-determining region (CDR) loop (orange) that penetrates the glycan shield (PDB ID: 5ACO) [244] . (E) The unique anti-oligomannose antibody, 2G12, featuring its unique "domain-exchanged" architecture where the heavy chains (orange) of the opposite Fab domain are swapped over (PDB ID: 6N2X) [245, 246] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
