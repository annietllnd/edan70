Two additional var genes were transcribed at high levels in NF54, PFL1960w (group C, localized on chromosome 12 in the 3D7 genome) and PF08_0106 (group B/C, on chromosome 8). By contrast, NF54VAR2CSA represents a highly homogeneous population, which transcribes almost solely var2csa (PFL0030c, on chromosome 12). All other var genes were transcribed at low levels or below the detection level ( Figure 1B ). Three primer sets targeting DBL2, DBL4, and the 5' UTR of var2csa, were used and the results obtained with these primers were tightly correlated ( Figure 1B) . Transcripts of var2csa were also detected in the unselected NF54 at low levels, similar to those of the less abundant var mRNA", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
