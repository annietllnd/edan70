Here, we can learn about the flexibility of the RNA under study using the Kuhn length which is a measure of the stiffness. Nascent RNA should have different properties from large functional RNA structures such as the ribosomal RNA. Furthermore, we detect expected polymer solvent effects (Ref. [20] ) when the size and complexity of the sequences increases. This is a characteristic of mature RNA involving long sequences. On the other hand, nascent RNA is less able to develop long range structure interactions and tends to form simple structure of short Kuhn length. As a result, vsfold5 provides important structural information about the RNA under study. No other prediction approach offers any information on the flexibility of the structure. It should not be expected that one button pushed answers all further questions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
