For this, we utilized confocal microscopy of live HEK293T cells transfected with a GFP-eVP40 fusion construct in the absence (vector alone) or presence of a BAG3-mCherry fusion construct (Fig 8A) . Representative images of live cells transfected with GFP-eVP40 alone revealed the expected pattern of expression in the cytoplasm with pronounced localization around the cell periphery and in PM projections (Fig 8A, top row) . In contrast, the pattern of GFP-eVP40 changed in cells co-expressing BAG3-mCherry, resulting in a more diffuse pattern of cytoplasmic localization with little to no PM projections (Fig 8A,  middle and bottom rows) . Indeed, this contrast in VP40 localization can be visualized in neighboring cells expressing GFP-eVP40 plus either low or high levels of BAG3-mCherry ( Fig  8A, middle row) . Thus, these representative live cell images suggest that localization and accumulation of eVP40 at the site of budding at the PM and in PM projections is reduced in the presence of BAG3.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
