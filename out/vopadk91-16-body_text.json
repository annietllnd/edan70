To analyze the requirement for the PBM of protein 3a for replication and virulence, a virus lacking a functional PBM in the 3a protein (3aPBM Ϫ ) was engineered. As ORF3a partially overlaps ORF3b, the protein 3a PBM core sequence (SVPL) was disrupted with amino acid substitutions (GMSM), with codons carefully selected to ensure that protein ORF3b was not mutated. Growth of the 3aPBM Ϫ mutant in Vero E6 cells and in the lungs of infected mice was the same as that seen with rSARS-CoV-MA15 (Fig. 7A) . Also, the 3aPBM Ϫ mutant was as pathogenic as the parental virus (Fig. 7B ). These results indicated that, in the mouse model, replication and virus virulence were independent of the PBM of protein 3a.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
