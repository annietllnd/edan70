Ninety-three of the stool samples contained unknown amounts of rRT-PCR inhibitors (Table 1; Fig. S1 ). The remaining ninety-two stools suspensions were selected from among 860 stool suspensions archived between 2009 and 2011 that had been sent for routine enterovirus analysis (Table 1 , Figs. 1, 2, 3 and S2 ). The RNA from these archived suspensions had been extracted manually with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and MS2 rRT-PCR and inhibition levels were known. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibitors .5 Ct were found in 93 (10.8%) of these samples. A non-random subset of 92 of these 860 samples (samples 101 to 192) with high, intermediate, and low levels of inhibitors were chosen for re-analysis so that would be a sufficient number of samples for comparison at each of these levels of inhibition.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
