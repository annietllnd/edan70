The comparison analysis of both up-and down-regulated genes simultaneously from three groups of infected animals was carried out to gain a global outlook of the canonical pathways that were modulated. The results were presented as a heat map based on activation z-score (Fig. 3) , which represents the bias in gene regulation that predicting whether the particular pathway is in an activated or inactivated state. In general, most of the processes were downregulated in DAN group, in contrast to ILI and BOR. More similarities were observed between ILI and BOR groups, although there were some pathways regulated differently in both groups. From 20 canonical pathways presented in Fig. 3 the pathways with applicable z-score were chosen for further analysis. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
