SRSF2 levels, on the other hand, are increased 2-3 weeks post infection and then decline again [48] . In CD4 + T-cells, the phosphorylation status of six SR proteins-including SRSF2-and five other splicing related proteins immediately changed after HIV-receptor interaction. Furthermore, most of these proteins were crucial for balanced HIV-1 transcripts and thus p24 levels [14] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
