HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well plate to 50% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS twice and cultured in the medium containing 2 mM of thymidine for 19 h. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and grown in normal DMEM containing 10% FBS for 9 h to allow cells to re-enter cell cycle. Then another round of cell cycle blocking was carried out by the addition of thymidine for 18 h. Cells were infected with CVB3 1 h before the termination of second round of synchronization. Then cells were cultured in normal medium for another 9 h.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
