Cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope and XZY scanning. Representative images displaying eVP40 (green) and BAG3-WT (red) or BAG3-ΔN (red) localized at the PM are shown. Cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue.
