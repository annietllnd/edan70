A similar approach was successfully applied to Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) 2 . Despite the difficulties in properly comparing the genome-wide specificities of Cas9 and Cas12a, it has been suggested that the specificity of Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a nucleases (AsCas12a) is similar to high-fidelity SpCas9 variants 3 . Furthermore, in the same publication, GUIDE-seq analysis and targeted deep sequencing for both AsCas12a and Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a (LbCas12a) showed no detectable off-target events with different crRNAs 3 . It was further demonstrated in another study using sustained expression of SpCas9 and gRNA in mouse liver from an adenoviral vector that appropriately designed guide RNAs can lead to effective editing with no detectable off-target mutations 4 . Our use of Cas RNP rather than coding mRNA or DNA (plasmids or viruses) offers the advantages of limiting exposure of the genome to editing machinery and decreasing off-target events 5 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
