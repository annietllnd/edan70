Recently, it was suggested that induction of more vigorous innate immune responses might control early virus dissemination following increasing infectious challenge doses of virus [6, 26, 66] . We have also recently discovered that interferon alpha receptor knockout induces dose-dependent mortality following extraneural infection with JaOArS982 (Hayasaka, et al., unpublished results) . In addition, we previously reported that late death following TBEV infection appears to be a key feature of dose independent mortality within the encephalitic flaviviruses [48] . In the current study, JaOArS982-infected mice also displayed increased times to death and the variation of acquired immune responses which either showed protective or pathological effects, appeared to be correlated with severe disease. Therefore, we propose that in addition to innate immune response, subsequent acquired immune responses, which varied contingently in individuals, appeared to be a determining factor associated with dose-independent mortality.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
