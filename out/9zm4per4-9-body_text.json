The predicted secondary structure is also shown for reference. The genomic form (Fig. 1b) of the structure largely forms by melting in the leading edge onto the first domain. Some structure is lost in the process first because of an assumed fixed Kuhn length of 8 nucleotides (nt) and second because there is currently no stability enhancement introduced by long range coaxial stacking effects on this short stem. (The Kuhn length measures the rigidity of the RNA and therefore tends to favorably weight the distribution of stem lengths accordingly.) Nevertheless, the most significant parts of the structure are found.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
