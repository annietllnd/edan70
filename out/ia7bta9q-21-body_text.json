NS5 also interacts with other viral replication proteins, the 59-SLA of the viral RNA genome, and cellular proteins that include transporters between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Therefore, NS5 may adopt drastically different conformations under different circumstances. The bNLS of NS5 contains a highly conserved core (residues 345-364) centers around a helix that is largely occluded by the MTase domain in the full-length structure, making three bimportin interacting candidates R355/K358/K360 inaccessible. Together with the fact that the NS3 binding site was also mapped to the same region of bNLS, these observations argue that unraveling of the 1480 Å 2 MTase-RdRP interface may occur if necessary. Among the two models of NS5 structure proposed previously, the 125 Å -long extended conformation suggested by SAXS data of DENV NS5 may reflect a form, rather than a defined conformation of NS5 with MTase and RdRP disengaged ( Fig. 6B ) [19] . The radius of gyration (R g ) values of the JEV NS5 structure and the DENV NS5 SAXS model are 31.7 Å and <36 Å , respectively, indicating that these two models indeed differ in compactness. The model based on reverse genetics data places the MTase off the front channel (Fig. 6C) [7] . Such an arrangement would favor cooperativity of the two enzymes, but the validation of this cooperative model requires further structural evidence at high resolution.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
