H9N2 viruses have been isolated from pigs and humans with influenza-like illness in Hong Kong and Mainland China [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , demonstrating that the H9N2 influenza virus could cross species barriers and expand its host range from birds to mammalians. Recently, a research showed that H9N2 viruses and pandemic H1N1 viruses have high genetic compatibility and they can produce higher pathogenic reassortment in experimental condition [10] . In addition, H9N2 viruses provide their six inner genes to contribute to the evolution of the H7N9, H10N8 and H5N6 viruses that cause severe human respiratory infections in China [11] [12] [13] . All these features indicate that H9N2 virus has a considerable public health threat. Thus, it is valuable to reveal the pathogenesis of H9N2 influenza virus infection and the innate immune responses of host to the H9N2 viruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
