Honey bees are essential pollinators of agriculturally important crops including apples, almonds, alfalfa, and citrus. Current agricultural practices, such as large-scale monocultures, demand a seasonal abundance of honey bees in geographic locations incapable of maintaining sufficient pollinator populations year-round. Migratory beekeeping operations fulfill this need. For example, each February in the Central Valley of California 1.3 million honey bee colonies (,50% of the U.S. honey bee population) are required for almond pollination [3, 4, 5] . Pollination of this and other U.S. crops is valued at ,$15 billion annually [5] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
