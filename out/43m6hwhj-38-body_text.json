Moreover, the results of the present study were consistent with the results of an experimental infection study, where the group infected with BOR strain developed acute clinical symptoms, in contrast to medium and mild severity in case of ILI and DAN strains, respectively [18] . The highest FC values obtained in BOR group for multiple genes (OAS1, Mx1, IFIT2, IFIT3, CXCL10, GZMA) involved in a range of immunological processes indicate the most pronounced inflammatory response. Also, BOR strain seems to have a higher general influence on the cells' metabolic processes and signaling pathways (down-regulation of cell cycle related G1/S Checkpoint Pathway, up-regulation of Integrin and Integrin-like Signaling Pathways, dysregulation of TOB activity, lack of up-regulation of Interferon Signaling Pathway in contrast to ILI and DAN strains).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
