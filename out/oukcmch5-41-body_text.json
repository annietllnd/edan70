The DM15 gene was isolated from a DH5 E. coli strain by DNA extraction and PCR. The gene was cloned into a pCAGGS vector for (transient) expression and into a MLV-based pQCXIP transfer vector (Clontech), resulting pQCXIP-DM15, for the generation of stable cell lines. The gene encoding the MHV receptor mCC1a [101] was cloned into pQCXIN, resulting in pQCXIN-mCC1a. The RNA transcription vectors used for the generation of recombinant MHV using targeted recombination were generated using pMH54 derivatives [98, 102] . pMH54 containing a GFP expression cassette between the E and M gene was generated as described previously for firefly luciferase [59] . The transcription vector used to generate MHV-S29FCS (pXHERLM-S29FCS+) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis, thereby changing the sequence encoding AIRGR immediately upstream of the FP into a RRRRR-encoding sequence in vector pXHERLM [59] (GCA9ATC9CGA9GGG9CGT to AGA9CGC9CGA9AGG9CGT). The transcription vector used to generate MHV-S4 expressing firefly luciferase, was generated by introducing the firefly luciferase expression cassette between the E and M genes similarly as described previously [59] in a pMH54derived transcription vector that contains the gene encoding the S protein of MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) [82] . This latter vector was kindly provided by Susan Weiss.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
