In both cases, the initial chest radiograph and thoracic CT showed diffuse infiltrations or ground glass opacities. Representative images are shown in Figure 1A , B. HSV-1 infection may feature a macroscopically vulnerable aspect of the bronchial mucosa as a nonspecific sign ( Figure 1C ). In order to increase diagnostic certainty in Case 2, immunohistochemical staining of bronchioalveolar cells for HSV-1 was performed, which proved positive ( Figure 2 ). In both cases inclusion bodies of epithelial cells from BAL were present. Our diagnosis in Case 1 and 2 was isolated HSV-1 pneumonitis, which was supported by the response to acyclovir in the absence of prolonged antibacterial treatment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
