The relatively constitutive transcription of var1csa may result from a dysfunction of the transcriptional regulation related to the cell cycle. As var1csa has an upstream promoter but is truncated at exon I, it can be hypothesized that its 5' UTR promoter, as previously demonstrated [34] is needed for exclusive transcription of a single var gene whereas the intron/exon II/ 3' UTR is needed for the observed wave shaped transcriptional regulation throughout the cell cycle. Yet, the abundance profile of var1csa during the complete intra-Total number of var transcripts in NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA Figure 3 Total number of var transcripts in NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA. Total var transcription is shown as relative copy number for both NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA. Total var transcription of both populations corresponds to the expression of the most abundant transcript, PFL0935c and var2csa (PFL0030c), respectively. The most striking difference in transcription is the slightly earlier distinctive peak for var2csa (PFL0030c) in NF54VAR2CSA compared to the broader wave-like appearance of var transcription in NF54. All measurements at the different time points were normalized against seryl-tRNA synthetase.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
