RT-PCR products were tested as per manufacturer's instructions for the following viruses: influenza A and B virus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1; parainfluenza virus; enterovirus or rhinoviruses; adenoviruses; and finally metapneumovirus, using the 12 league respiratory virus multiple PCR detection kit (Neuro-Hemin Hangzhou, RV1211). The PCR amplification system was as follows: cDNA templates 3 ml, 56RV Primer 4 ml, 8-Mop Solution 3 ml, and 26Multiplex Master Mix 10 ml. PCR was carried out in a PCR Amplifier and the conditions were as follows: 94uC for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94uC for 0.5 minutes, 60uC for 1.5 minutes and 72uC for 1.5 minutes, with extension at 72uC for 10 minutes, followed by storage at 4uC until collected. The samples were divided into two groups for testing, Group A samples were tested for the presence of adenovirus (Adv), metapneumovirus (MPV), human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3. Group B samples were tested for the presence of influenza B virus, human coronavirus OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus (HRV A/B), RSV B/A, and FLU A.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
