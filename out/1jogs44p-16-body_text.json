Likewise, most non-primate mammals (e.g., cat, guinea pig, tree shrew, rabbit, squirrel, cow, hedgehog, microbat, shrew, elephant, small Madagascar hedgehog, and armadillo) contained 4-6 CEACAM homologs. There is an absence of PSG-like genes in these species, suggesting that PSG genes of dry-nosed primates were derived from lineage-specific duplications. Among nonprimate eutherians investigated, rodents appeared to be the only group to have a large number of CEACAM homologs (16 in rats and 27 in mice) [20, 21, 42] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
