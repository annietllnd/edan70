The observed differences in IgG titers were not statistically significant between the two routes at 10 6 or 10 7 pfu, but were statistically significant at 10 5 pfu, suggesting that the percutaneous delivery of MVA-gD2 may be more effective than subcutaneous inoculation in eliciting HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies at lower vaccine doses. Consistent with previous reports [48, 49] , percutaneous inoculation of MVA-gD2 also elicited cell-mediated immune responses, as evident in the secretion of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 by re-stimulated immune splenocytes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
