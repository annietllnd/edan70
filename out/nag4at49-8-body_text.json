The CM5 chip was immobilized on all flow cells with mouse anti-human IgG (Fc specific) according to the Biacore Human Antibody Capture Kit (Cat# BR-1008-39) to ~ 7000 RU. Anti-PCSK9 antibodies were captured on the chip to ~ 500 RU followed by analyte injections of wild-type human PCSK9 from 0.156 nM to 2.5 nM, except for the 96-well affinity measurements were crude supernatants were captured followed by a single injection of 2.5 nM of rhPCSK9. Each flowcell was regenerated between each analyte injection with 3 M MgCl for 40 s at 10 μl/min. Data was analyzed with Biacore T100 Evaluation Software using the 1/1 binding model.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
