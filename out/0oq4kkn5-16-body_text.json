The four enzymes cover a broad range of S1-preferences, namely for arginine/lysine (trypsin, factor Xa), hydrophobic residues (chymotrypsin) and aspartate (caspase-3). Compound 14 was inactive towards all four proteases (IC 50 4500 mM); compound 20 was inactive towards the three serine proteases (IC 50 4500 mM) and revealed very low inhibition of the cysteine protease caspase-3 (IC 50 4300 mM) (Supplementary Table 3 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
