The procedure was performed according to Lin et al. [3] . Gating in a dot plot of FSC vs. SSC was routinely applied to exclude cell debris and to include a population of single cells with similar size for analysis and sorting. For each sort, the 1% of cells with the brightest signal were gated and 5000-10,000 total cells were collected. Flow cytometry data were analyzed with software FlowJo v 7.1.2 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
