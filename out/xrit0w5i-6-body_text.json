Secondly, we detected levels of interferonɑ/β using ELISA kits. Thirdly, we observed the effect of HA and NA on IFITM1 expression, and located the position of inactivated viral particles in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated IFITM1-mediated antiviral response by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection. To compare the expression patterns of IFITM1 between endothelial cells and epithelial cells, all of the above experiments were performed on human epithelial cells at the same time.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
