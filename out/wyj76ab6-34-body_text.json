According to WHO guidelines, hand hygiene is the most important infection prevention and control measure against EBOV [6] . Generally, there are two methods of hand hygiene, social hand washing and hygienic hand disinfection [32, 33] . Socially clean hands are achieved using soap and water, which removes transient microorganisms. Social hand washing should be practised before and after performing routine tasks in all clinical areas. Hygienic hand disinfection is carried out with alcohol-based hand rubs toto remove or destroy all transient microorganisms, and may have a prolonged effect. It is recommended, for example, Since the skin is a routine source of infection transmission, the use of PVP-I for hand disinfection may be an alternative to WHO recommended alcohol-based hand rubs. Medicated soaps containing PVP-I are available. Thus, the hygiene measure of hand washing is supported by the virucidal effect of PVP-I. This could be extended beyond surgical use. Healthcare professionals, patients, family members and professionals at risk of infection could use these products to protect themselves after exposure to patients. PVP-I soap has shown similar efficacy to alcoholbased hand sanitisers against norovirus in a hand wash model [27] . Chlorhexidine-and triclosan-based hand washes, however, were not effective against norovirus in suspension tests and practical application tests [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
