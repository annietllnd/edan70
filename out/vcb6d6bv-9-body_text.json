The pathway that a protein uses to reach its final destination depends, primaryly, on the interactions of the polypeptide nascent chain once it emerges from the ribosome exit tunnel. Most cellular membrane proteins encode in their Nt a short sequence known as signal sequence (SS). In the case of ER targeting the SS consists of a continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues (6 to 20) with one or more basic residues to one side of the hydrophobic core [25] . Once the SS is outside of the ribosome exit tunnel it is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). The SRP will, through interactions with the ribosome, transiently stop translation [26] and subsequently dock the ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex to the ER membrane via the SRP receptor (SR) [27] . The ribosome with the nascent chain is then transferred to the translocon, a multiprotein complex that facilitates polypeptide translocation across and insertion into the ER membrane. Upon SRP disengage the translation re-starts and the insertion into the membrane proceeds through the translocon. In this case, the translocation/insertion of the nascent chains occurs while the protein is being translated, that is to say, co-translationally. Alternatively, in the absence of a cleavable SS, the SRP can recognize a TM segment (if its hydrophobicity, length and location within the protein sequence are compatible with SRP requirements). In this case, the TM domain performs a dual function as a signal sequence and as membrane anchor domain. The absence of a SS is relatively common among viral membrane proteins, specially in an RNA virus where genome space is exceptionally restricted.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
