Unexpectedly, we observed that the complete genome sequences of HAdV-7d isolates from mild, severe and fatal respiratory diseases were almost indistinguishable. Also surprisingly, strains IP04_2011 (severe case) and IP06_2012 (mild case) were 100% identical with each other as well as with the fatal strain (0901/HZ/ShX/2009) from the 2009 ARD outbreak 7, 15 ; the other five strains had only a few nucleotide mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the complete genomes were chosen to be analyzed. All the seven HAdV-7 isolates in this study have identical REA profiles with each other, different from the Gomen prototype, identified as genome type HAdV-7d. M, molecular weight markers corresponding to a 500 bp DNA Ladder (A) and DL10,000 DNA Marker (B) respectively. Nota bene: the agarose gel electrophoresis of RE digested genomic DNA was not run at the same time but under the same conditions. of three isolates from different periods were identical with each other, which confirms the expected degree of genomic sequence conservation and stability of HAdVs. Based on the genome sequence identity, we conclude that strains IP04_2011 and IP06_2012 in Guangzhou originated from strain 0901/HZ/ShX/2009 in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, although both cities are more than 1,000 kilometers apart. The unexpectedly high genome identities between isolates from mild, severe and fatal cases indicate that the difference in HAdV-7d pathogenicity may be due to host immunity. The detailed risk factors associated with adverse consequences caused by HAdV-7d merit further investigation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
