Their common epitope consists of Phe/ Leu506, Asp510, Trp535, Glu536, Asp539, Tyr540, Tyr541, Arg542, and Trp553. Although antibodies in both Group 1 and Group 2 share the binding residues Trp535, Glu536 and Asp539, their approaching angles to the RBD are significantly different. As shown in Figure 4 (C), the approaching angle of Group 2 antibodies is closer to that of DPP4 by rotating approximately 90 degrees anti-clockwise from that of Group 1 antibodies, thereby generating more steric clashes with DPP4. This is also evidenced by a larger overlap between the common epitope of Group 2 antibodies and DPP4-binding site on RBD [23] . As a representative of Group 2 antibodies, m336 exhibits very potent neutralizing activity by not only mimicking critical interactions between RBD and DPP4 but also adopting an approaching angle similar to that of DPP4 (Figure 4(C) ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
