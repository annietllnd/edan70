The data presented in Fig. 4D suggest that the tetherin-Vpu interaction is required for the ability of SGTA to increase expression of the non-glycosylated species. Because SGTA is a Vpu-interacting protein, this raises the possibility that a ternary SGTA-Vpu-tetherin complex forms in cells expressing these three proteins. To test this hypothesis, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged SGTA in the absence and presence of Vpu (WT and RKR mutant) and HA-tagged tetherin. As shown in Fig. 5 , although several forms of tetherin are expressed in cells, only the 23-kDa tetherin species is co-immunoprecipitated with SGTA in the presence of Vpu. We also observed Vpu in the co-immnoprecipitate (Fig. 5) . Compared to WT Vpu, only 60 Â± 5.2% of the Vpu RKR mutant was co-immunoprecipitated by SGTA when normalized to input (average of three independent experiments). These results support the existence of a ternary SGTA-Vpu-tetherin interaction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
