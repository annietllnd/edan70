Stochastic simulations allowed for variation of inputs values which are reflected in ranges of potential outcomes, unlike a static model which will always produce the same outcome. Modeling variables stochastically, such as weaning age, mortality rates, and disease prevalence, we can simulate different outcomes. All variables were modeled following a Pert distribution set with minimum, most likely, and maximum value. Assumptions were made based on published literature, surveys, and market assumptions were also used to calculate the total cost (Table 1) . A month in the cost spreadsheet was considered 30 days. This model is available online at https://afs.ca.uky.edu/dairy/decision-tools, wherein all variables and assumptions can be modified to reflect different situations and individual farms.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
