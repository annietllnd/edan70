[22] showed the presence of a circulating infectious 4/91 strain in Indonesia. Sequences obtained from Wibowo et al. [17] were 4/91-like IBV originating from Indonesia in 2017 to 2018. These sequences were included in our phylogenetic analysis but appeared to be slightly different from our isolated virus in each of the nucleotides numbered: 55, 80, 98, 175, 211, 223, and 225. However, two sequences from Setiawaty et al. [22] showed 100% similarity (Indonesia/K233A31/18 and Indonesia/K4A9/17) to our isolated gene and only one ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
