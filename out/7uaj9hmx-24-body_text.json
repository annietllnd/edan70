Resting MDMs produced approximately 300 pg/mL IL-10 throughout the course of the experiments (Fig 6) . PRRSV infected cells secreted significantly less IL-10 compared to control cells at 2 and 12 hours p.i. (Fig 6) . IL-10 levels did not significantly change versus controls when uninfected cells were treated with tulathromycin alone. However, Immuno-modulating properties of Tulathromycin in PRRSV-infected porcine monocyte-derived macrophages PRRSV-induced IL-10 inhibition was abolished when the cells were pre-treated with tulathromycin at 2 and 12 hours post infection (Fig 6) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
