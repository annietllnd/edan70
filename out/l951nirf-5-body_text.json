VLPs are formed by structural viral proteins, which have an inherent tendency to self-assemble and mimic the morphology of the pathogen [25] . In contrast to live viruses, VLPs are non-infective and non-replicating, since they are essentially devoid of pahogenetic material [24] . Moreover, VLPs have been known to enhance immunogenicity by presenting antigenic epitopes in correct conformation, resulting in strong humoral and cellular immune responses [24, 26, 27] . Given these advantages, VLPs have been widely used for vaccine development and other biomedical applications [28] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
