There is a total of 8 mucin-type O-glycan cores, with 4 common core structures (cores 1-4), each of which can be processed further as proteins pass through the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1C ). Unlike Nlinked glycosylation, which is identifiable by a specific amino acid sequon, no such simplicity has been identified for O-linked glycosylation, most likely due to differential peptide substrate preferences of multiple ppGalNAcTs. However, O-linked glycosylation in mucin-like domains can be detected by their high levels of serine, threonine and proline residues [33, 34] , and more recent developments have improved prediction of individual O-linked glycosylation sites in non-mucin-like domains [33, [35] [36] [37] . The heterogeneous occupancy and composition of O-linked glycosylation constitutes a major challenge in studies of glycan structure and function. A number of viral proteins, notably Ebola GP and sGP [38] , herpes simplex virus gC protein [39] , and respiratory syncytial virus G protein [40] contain mucin-like domains with high populations of serine and threonine residues, that are heavily modified by mucin-type O-linked glycans.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
