We analyzed the conservation profile in all families and in the identified viral proteins. Where a three-dimensional structure of one of the proteins was available, we have mapped sequence differences onto it and analyzed their distribution with respect to active sites and other important protein regions. Next, we collected all viral sequences significantly similar to the HMM profile of the corresponding Pfam family and constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees with bootstraps. The analysis of these trees reveals two distinct patterns of the distribution of viral sequences: either sequences from viruses from two Baltimore classes are present in comparable and large numbers, and the bootstrap support values do not allow for distinguishing whether the parts of the tree covered by each Baltimore class are monophyletic (balanced distribution); or one or very few sequences from one Baltimore class cluster together on a single branch of the phylogeny with a good bootstrap support, and the rest of the tree is interspersed with sequences from viruses from the other Baltimore class (unbalanced distribution). We will consider now each of these scenarios in detail and discuss the possible evolutionary implications.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
