Viral RNA was extracted from 140 ml of viral transport medium containing the swabs, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Extraction Kit, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was then used as the template to perform the RT-PCR reaction, using a reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit (Fermentas, Shenzhen). cDNA was compounded under the action of reverse transcriptase and random primers from RNA. The RT-PCR amplification system was as follows: total RNA 8 ml, random primers 1 ml, 56RT buffer 4 ml, 10 mM dNTP 2 ml, RNA inhibitor 1 ml, and 1 ml reverse transcriptase added to DEPC treated water to 20 ml. Conditions used for the two-step RT-PCR were as follows: the primary RT-PCR was incubated at 80uC for 3 minutes, cooled down on ice for 2 minutes; followed by 37uC for 90 minutes and 94uC for 2 minutes, then cooled down on ice for a further 2 minutes, and stored at 220uC until collected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
