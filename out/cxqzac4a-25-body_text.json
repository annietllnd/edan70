Although most patients were diagnosed as having CVA16 or EV71 infections by the qRT-PCR analysis, some were negative for Enterovirus. To identify the pathogens responsible for Enterovirus-negative HFMD children, samples from each of the patients were subjected to EOPM analysis. About 1 mg of a feces sample was used to extract RNA, using a TIANamp Virus DNA/RNA Kit, and labeled with Cy5 following random amplification. In The probes were ranked by ratio of cy5/cy3 intensity. Non-infected cell samples were labeled with cy3, and virus infected cell samples were labeled with cy5. parallel, RNA extracted from normal feces was labeled with Cy3 and used as a control. The enrichment analysis at the species level identified Theiler's-like Cardiovirus as the most probable pathogen responsible for the HFMD infection in these patients ( Table 7) . Analysis of the enrichment results at the genus level revealed Cardiovirus as the number one match, showing significant enrichment ( The microarray raw data of other symptom-causing pathogens, such as streptococcus and mycoplasma, identified by EOPM in peripheral blood in infectious patients, were also submitted to the GEO database.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
