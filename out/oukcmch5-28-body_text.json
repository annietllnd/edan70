Infection with FIPV was significantly affected by siRNAmediated downregulation of proteins required for late endosometo-lysosome fusion ( Figure 10B ). Since the requirement for a functional HOPS complex is indicative of fusion in lysosomes, as we observed for MHV, we analyzed whether FIPV requires processing by lysosomal proteases for efficient entry as well. The results indicate that this is indeed the case as FIPV-driven luciferase expression was diminished in the presence of the panlysosomal protease inhibitor CPI (Fig. 10C) . On the other hand, infection with FIPV was not affected by FI.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
