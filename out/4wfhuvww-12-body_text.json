As a consequence, ANXA2 has been suggested as a more general antiviral regulator in eukaryotic cells. Other potential anti-viral agents could either specifically bind to the frameshift signal (such as antisense oligonucleotides, non-coding RNAs, or frameshift signal binding compounds) or interfere with peptidyltransferase activity (e.g., anisomycin or sparsomycin) or eEF2 activity (e.g., sordarin) (Dinman, 2012b) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
