Although the gene product of PA0441 has been described as a dihydropyrimidinase, the substrate specificities of dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase may differ. For example, the recombinant hydantoinase from Agrobacterium radiobacter prefers 5-leucinyl-hydantoin to phthalimide and dihydrouracil (~two orders of magnitude), as revealed by the catalytic efficiencies [12] . To ensure that the gene product of PA0441 is suitably identified as a dihydropyrimidinase, we analyzed the substrate specificity of this dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil (Fig 1B) , phthalimide ( Fig 1C) , 5-propyl-hydantoin ( Fig 1D) , allantoin, and dihydroorotate, which are typical substrates for dihydropyrimidinase, imidase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, respectively (Table 3) . Unlike A. radiobacter hydantoinase, the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme toward dihydrouracil was higher than that toward phthalimide (fourfold) and 5-propyl-hydantoin (100-fold). Therefore, this bacterial enzyme was suitably identified as a dihydropyrimidinase, not a hydantoinase.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
