Areas of myocardium with highly enriched populations of cardiomyocytes (i.e., avoiding all small to large vessels and adipocytes) were identified and isolated. The isolation of cells of interest was verified by microscopic examination of the LCM cap as well as of the excised region after microdissection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
