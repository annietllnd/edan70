We used BLASTn and BLASTx against the EMBL and UniProt databases, respectively, with an E value of 10000 for both. Taxonomic classification was then undertaken with the blast2taxoclass program (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal. py#forms::blast2taxoclass), and sequences assigned to viruses were then annotated with blast2genoclass (http://mobyle. pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::blast2genoclass), as previously described [33] . Classified contig sequences were extracted and analyzed further in phylogenetic studies or used for the design of specific primers.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
