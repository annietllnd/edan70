Using a pH-independent route, the virus attaches to its host cell and by interacting with its corresponding host-cell receptor induces conformational changes of the viral glycoprotein causing the fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the target cell. This directly leads to the delivery of the capsid into the cytoplasm followed by its uncoating. In a second route which is pH-dependent, the virus enters the cell via endocytosis, a process essential in eukaryotes to internalize extracellular molecules. In this process the virus is first engulfed into early endosomes, which later on mature into late endosomes with a low pH, inducing the necessary conformational change of the viral glycoprotein to induce fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Non-enveloped viruses can also enter through endocytotic mechanisms, however they cross this internal membrane by pore formation or penetration of the membrane [15] (Figure 2 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
