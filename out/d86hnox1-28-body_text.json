If we express the sequences of the proteins X and Y in the simplified alphabet {Φ, ϕ, Π, π}, the simplified sequences can be exactly expressed by a dual gene in the F = −2 frame, with the exception of the (π, π) pairs, which would sometimes be replaced by (π, Π) pairs. Thus, in an ancestral world with a simpler {Φ, φ, Π, π} amino acid alphabet, arbitrary overlapping genes could be encoded almost perfectly thanks to the properties of the genetic code 26 , exploited by the F = −2 reading frame. This would presumably have been favorable for genome compaction and consequently for viruses, which evolve essentially at fixed capsid volume.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
