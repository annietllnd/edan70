In principle, such proteins might be involved in any cellular process, but may be correlated with certain cellular pathways. For instance, amino acid starvation can induce frameshifting in bacteria (Barak et al., 1996) . One hypothesis is that this is due to a short supply of amino-acylated tRNA as a consequence of amino acid limitations. This is supported by the observation that antizyme expression (the +1 frame) is maintained under conditions of amino acid starvation, while expression of ODC (the 0 frame) is reduced in rat intestinal epithelial cells (Ray et al., 2012) . Moreover, treatment with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin also reduce 0 frame expression while maintaining antizyme expression. One could hypothesize that reduced fidelity in translation may enhance frameshifting. On the other hand, both translation inhibition and amino acid starvation are conditions that increase autophagy in eukaryotic cells, raising the possibility that the production of outof-frame proteins may be functionally coupled to the regulation of autophagy.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
