We co-expressed FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant and His-tagged Lsm11 NTD (residues 23-130) in E. coli and purified their complex, demonstrating a stable interaction between the two proteins (S2 Fig) . Extensive efforts at producing diffraction quality crystals of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex have so far been unsuccessful. To obtain estimates for the molar masses of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex as well as the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments using buffers with high (500 mM) and low (250 mM) NaCl concentrations ( Fig 5, S3 Fig) . At high-salt concentration, both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD alone eluted in single peaks. However, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge, suggesting some dissociation of the complex during chromatography. The weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 31 kDa for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex (with a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm) and 21 kDa for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone (with a Stokes radius In the low-salt buffer, the positions of the peaks for both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant were slightly shifted to the left, suggesting a more extended structure for both. A small amount of higher order structures was present for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex suggesting the formation of aggregates in low-salt buffer condition. As in the high-salt buffer, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge. The weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 34.3 kDa for FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex (with a Stokes radius of 4.3 nm) and 21.8 kDa for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A (with a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm). Due to the presence of higher order structures, the molar mass of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex decreased gradually from 55 kDa and higher (leading edge of peak) to 26 kDa (trailing edge of peak). The FLASH NTD C54S/C83A molar mass decreased from 23.5 kDa (leading edge) to 19 kDa (trailing edge). Overall, the polydispersity of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex was slightly higher in low-salt buffer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
