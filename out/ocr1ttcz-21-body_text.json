We next determined the protective effect of mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccines in both female and male BALB/c mice. Mice were vaccinated intranasally with a single dose (10 6 PFU) of each recombinant virus, and were challenged intravenously with 1 Ã— 10 6 PFU of ZIKV Cambodian strain (FSS13025) at week 5 postimmunization. DNA vaccine (pCI-prM-E) was used as a control and was given intramuscularly twice (at week 0 and 2). Similar to the previous observation shown in Fig. 2f , rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was the most attenuated virus, experiencing no weight losses ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). All other recombinant viruses showed 9-15% weight loss at early time points but weights were recovered at day 14 ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Previously, it was shown that the administration of anti-IFNAR1 antibody can render BALB/c mice more susceptible to infection of a mouse-adapted African ZIKV strain (Dakar 41519) 18 . Similarly, we passively transferred 1.8 mg of a blocking antibody, anti-IFNAR1, to each mouse 24 h prior to intravenous challenge with the ZIKV Cambodian strain. After ZIKV challenge, mice were monitored for 4 weeks. Unexpectedly, no significant weight loss or clinical symptoms were observed in any group including the unvaccinated but challenged controls ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
