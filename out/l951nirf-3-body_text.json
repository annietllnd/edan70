However, traditional egg-based influenza vaccines have several limitations, including vulnerability of supply chain, the necessity for selecting strains a priori, allergic reactions to egg proteins in the vaccine, and an often timeconsuming production process-all important issues that need to be addressed [9] . To overcome these limitations, many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . One such alternative approach is baculoviruses, which do not replicate or impose any apparent cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, thus minimizing possible side effects [15, 16] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
