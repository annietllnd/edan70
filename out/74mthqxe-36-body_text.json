Briefly, 293/LH2SN or COS7/LH2SN cells, either parental (mock) or derivatives stably expressing IFITMs, were seeded in 6-well plates and cotransfected with 2 mg plasmids encoding JSRV Env or 10A1 MLV Env with the R peptide deleted (10A1 Env-R 2 ), or 0.5 mg plasmids encoding IAV HA, plus 0.5 mg peGFP-N1 (Clontech) using the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with pre-warmed buffer (pH 6.2, pH 5.5, pH 5.0 etc.) for 1 min and were examined for syncytium formation under a fluorescence microscope. If applicable, cells were incubated with indicated doses of IFN-a2b for 24 h before being treated with a low pH buffer to induce syncytia. For 10A1 Env-R 2 , IFN-a2b was added upon transfection and was maintained throughout the entire fusion assay. The fusion index was calculated by using f = [1-(C/ N)], where C is the number of cells per phase field after fusion, and N is the total number of nuclei [69] . At least five phase-contrast microscopy fields were used for the analysis, with means and standard deviations calculated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
