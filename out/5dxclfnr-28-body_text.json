Both viral EBV transcriptional activators, BZLF1 and BRLF1, can reactivate the lytic form of viral replication with BRLF1 acting in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner as inhibition of PI3K abolishes BRLF1-induced transcriptional activation [67] . Recently, however, for two other herpes viruses, murine gamma herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) and human herpesvirus-8/Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV8/KSHV), Peng and coworkers demonstrated that Akt promotes viral persistence by suppressing transcriptional reactivation of these viruses rather than reactivating lytic replication. In this case reactivation or the transition from latency to lytic replication is controlled by the viral transcription activator (RTA), an immediately-early (IE) gene, whose activity is negatively regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway [68] . They observed enhanced MHV-68 production in permissive fibroblast after either LY294002 treatment in a dose-dependent manner or RNAi-mediated Akt1 silencing. For the various other capabilities of the virus to modulate host cell pathways for longer periods the reader is referred to the detailed review by Cooray [69] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
