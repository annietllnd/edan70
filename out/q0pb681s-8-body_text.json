Gel images were digitized with the FX Pro Plus Multi imager system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the PD Quest version 7.3 software (Bio-Rad). Spots detected by the program were matched between each gel in each group. Normalized protein spot volume (area multiplied by stain intensity) was calculated for each spot in the control sample and compared to its counterpart (sample from ASFV-infected animals). Intensity data were used to calculate differences in protein expression between groups (controls vs. E75 or E75CV1 infected samples), for each dpi, using a Student's t test (p < 0.05) (two-tailed with unequal variances) after checking normality by the Wilks-Shapiro test. Differentially expressed spots were selected for protein identification by mass spectrometry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
