This conformation allows DRBPs to bind non-specifically to dsRNAs. Indeed, the lack of nucleotide binding recognition suggests that target specificity may generally be governed through interactions with other proteins, since many DRBPs bind strongly but nonspecifically to any dsRNA structure in vitro. GIV NS4 can protect dsRNA from degradation by RNAse III endoribonucleases, confirming previous sequence analyses indicating the presence of a dsRNA-binding domains [18] . BTV NS4 which is half the theoretical size of its counterpart in GIV, lacks dsRNA binding domains and did not protect dsRNA from Dicer or RNAse III. NS4 of GIV and BTV both failed to protect ssRNA or ssDNA from degradation by RNAse A, or nuclease S1 respectively (data not shown). However, NS4 of both GIV and BTV did protect dsDNA from degradation by DNAse I, indicating an ability to bind dsDNA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
