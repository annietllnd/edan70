Different cleavage sites have been identified for different CoVs, the importance of which seems to differ for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. Some CoV S proteins, including that of MHV strain A59, are cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary by furin(like) proteases during transport of the newly assembled virions through the secretory pathway of the producer cell [30] [31] [32] [33] . Inhibition of this S protein cleavage was shown to inhibit cell-cell fusion, but not to affect entry of MHV strain A59 into host cells [30, 34, 35] . MHV strain 2 contains an S protein that is not cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary. Interestingly, although MHV strains 2 and A59 were both reported to enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, entry of MHV 2 but not of MHV A59, was blocked by inhibitors of low-pH activated cathepsin proteases [27, 36] . Inhibitors of cathepsin proteases have also been shown to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV and feline CoVs [23, 37, 38] , while treatment of cell-bound virus particles with different proteases was shown to enhance virus entry and/or cell-cell fusion [27, 34, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . For SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), it appears that a proteolytic cleavage of the S protein at a more downstream position than the S1/S2 boundary upon receptor binding is of importance for cell entry [40, 43, [46] [47] [48] [49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
