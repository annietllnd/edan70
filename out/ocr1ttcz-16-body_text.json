We next tested the MTase-defective VSV (mtdVSV)-based vaccines in BALB/c mice. Intranasal wild-type rVSV killed the mice within 7 days (Fig. 2f ). Mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A or rVSV-G1670A-E showed 13 and 7% weight loss at day 7 postinfection but both recovered by day 10 (Fig. 2f ). Mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E exhibited 1-2% body weight loss but were not significantly different with DMEM control (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 2f) or VSV-associated clinical symptoms, indicating high degree of attenuation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
