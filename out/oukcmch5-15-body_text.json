However, assays based on reporter gene expression driven by virus replication do not allow discrimination between virus entry and RNA replication when analyzing siRNAs or agents that also affect RNA synthesis. To unequivocally demonstrate the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome maturation for MHV entry, we therefore made use of a fusion assay we recently developed [63] . The assay is based on minimal complementation of defective bgalactosidase (b-galactosidase DM15) with the short a-peptide [64] . MHV-aN, a recombinant MHV containing an N protein tagged with the a-peptide (aN), is used to infect DM152fragment expressing target cells. Upon fusion of the virion with a host cell membrane aN is released into the cytoplasm resulting in complementation of the defective b-galactosidase thereby reconstituting a functional enzyme. Conversion of the non-fluorescent substrate fluorescein-di-b-D-galactopyranoside (FDG) by b-galactosidase into green fluorophores fluorescein (FIC) can be measured by FACS or fluorescence microscopy ( Figure S2 in Text S1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
