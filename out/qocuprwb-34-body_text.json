In severe cases, JEV antigens were detected in neurons, and degenerated neurons were observed in a wide area of the brain cortex and medulla ( Figure 4A ). On the other hand, in mild cases, there was variation of pathological features in some JaOArS982-infected mice. Other mild cases showed neuronal infections similar to those observed in severe cases but there was little neuronal degeneration in the brain cortex ( Figure 4B ). Other mice exhibited very limited evidence of neuronal infection and neuronal degeneration ( Figure 4C ). Mock-infected mice showed none of these pathological changes ( Figure 4D ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
