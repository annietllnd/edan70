A comparison of these new SFTSV sequences with the sequence of this novel virus showed that they were highly homologous (.99% identity). Using sequences of Phlebovirus available in GenBank, a phylogenetic analysis showed that, although most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage), the three genomic segments of the novel virus, along with the SFTSV sequences, were highly divergent ( Figure 1B-1E ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
