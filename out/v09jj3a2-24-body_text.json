Four Hospital A staff members with confirmed SARS-CoV infection did not complete the questionnaire or participate in the serosurvey. All 32 confirmed SARS cases that did participate in the survey tested positive for the presence of antibody to SARS-CoV antigen. Four additional, previously unrecognized, seropositive individuals were identified as a consequence of the serosurvey. Thus, 4 of the 36 initially identified SARS cases during the outbreak did not have serological confirmation, and they were replaced by the 4 additional, previously unrecognized, seropositive individuals identified as a consequence of the serosurvey (n = 36).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
