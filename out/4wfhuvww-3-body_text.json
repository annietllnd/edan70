Indels generally produce nonfunctional proteins and are associated with either spontaneous mutations across the genome or somatic genomic instability, for instance, as a consequence of tumour progression. By contrast, programmed ribosomal frameshifting can result in dual-coding genes that produce alternative functional proteins, which form an integral part of the organism's physiology.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
