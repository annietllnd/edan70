BALB/c mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 100,000 PFU of virus mixed with 50 l of DMEM. Weight loss and mortality were evaluated daily. To determine SARS-CoV titers, lungs were homogenized in PBS containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone), using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.). Virus titrations were performed in Vero E6 cells as previously described (61) . Viral titers were expressed as PFU counts per gram of tissue.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
