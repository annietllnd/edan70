The most prominent effector of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt (for review see [9] ). After binding of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to PIP 3 , Akt becomes phosphorylated at Thr308 by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and at Ser473 by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) leading to its full activation. Notably, stimulus-dependent, as in the case of the DNA-damage response, Ser473 is phosphorylated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) [10, 11] . Finally, several downstream targets like tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2; translation), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; cell growth), or Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD; cell survival) and forkhead box protein (FOXO; cell survival) are altered in their function through the Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Termination of this signaling cascade can occur through the dephosphorylation of PIP 3 either by the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or the Src homology domain 2 containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP). Akt activity can also be directly abolished through its dephosphorylation carried out by phosphatases like the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or the H domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) [12, 13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
