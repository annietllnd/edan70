It is recognized to play a major role in the evolution of bacterial virulence and resistance [17, 18] . Viruses, specifically retroviruses, facilitate horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes [19, 20] . However, it has never been systematically studied whether viruses exchange genetic information between each other via horizontal gene transfer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
