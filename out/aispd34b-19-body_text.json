This is most evident in Figure 3 showing relative copy numbers of the most abundant var transcript as well as total var transcripts in both populations. The transcript abundance peak of var2csa in both parasite populations emerges slightly earlier in the ring stage of the parasite development and also declines faster than for the other var genes ( Figure 1A and  3 ). In addition, the broad transcript abundance peak in NF54 seems to consist of two waves, a pattern which was observed for all the var genes ( Figure 1A and 3) . No differences between the various var gene groups (A, B and C)", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
