These observations suggest an HIV-1-induced PI3K/Akt-dependent modulation of splicing regulation, which seems to be essential for the viral life cycle. In sum, these results emphasize the importance of splicing regulatory proteins for proper HIV-1 splicing, yet the impact on cellular alternative splicing and reprogramming in favor of viral replication has not yet been examined. It will take further effort to uncover the number of viruses targeting the cellular splicing machinery to support and modulate gene expression. The identification of the cellular players concerned will likewise help decipher the biological relevance of the PI3K/Akt pathway regarding the regulation of pre-mRNA processing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
