The distribution of personnel between clinical and non-clinical roles is shown in Table  1 . Twenty-nine of the 36 SARS cases (81%) at Hospital A occurred among clinical personnel with direct patient care or ancillary clinical roles. Direct patient care activities included primary medical functions such as patient examination and diagnostic evaluation, performance of procedures, and conduct of ongoing care and monitoring. In addition, non-clinical personnel were affected as well, with 19% of cases (n = 7) occurring among housekeepers and other cleaning staff (n = 5), kitchen staff (n = 1), and receptionists (n = 1). Several of the affected housekeepers entered the index patient's room on the night he was admitted to clean vomitus and respiratory secretions from the floor and walls, and various kitchen staff entered his room to deliver meals or collect service trays.
