ETEST Â® is a method to supplement testing with antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) reagent strips that determine minimum inhibitory concentrations [54] . Recently, SeLux has developed a Next Generation Phenotyping (NGP) platform, which is a high-throughput, fully-automated AST testing system, enabling same-shift susceptibility testing of up to 50 antibiotics in parallel [55] . This assay differentiates antibiotic-induced bacterial growth modes with a surface-binding fluorescent amplifier.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
