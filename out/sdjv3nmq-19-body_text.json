Compared with Bcl2-transfected cells, a slightly higher PARP cleavage was observed in Bcl2 (S70A)-transfected cells at 24 hpi, possibly due to its lower ectopic Bcl2 level. In summary, IBV infection did not induce detectable phosphorylation of endogenous Bcl2. Although ectopic Bcl2 was phosphorylated at Ser70, it was not mediated by JNK and did not contribute to antiapoptotic activity during IBV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
