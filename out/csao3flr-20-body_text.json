All proteins were exchanged into PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.4) by gel filtration. The purified mAb was first immobilized on a CM5 chip. The HA1 proteins were serially diluted to between 0.078 and 2.5 nM (0.078, 0.156, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 nM) and were then flowed over the mAb. The binding kinetics were analyzed with BIAcore 3000 analysis software (BIAevaluation Version 4.1) using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
