For instance, the case definition has been revised over time, and, as of 12 February 2020, reported cases of the disease incorporate clinically suspected cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases, which led to a noticeable increase in cases in the province of Hubei on 13 February 2020. These additional cases are likely historical cases that occurred days or weeks earlier. In the absence of additional information, this change in reporting obscures the true underlying epidemic trajectory, especially in Hubei, and complicates the inference of epidemiological parameters, such as the effective reproduction number, and the calibration of mechanistic transmission models that rely on data after 12 February 2020.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
