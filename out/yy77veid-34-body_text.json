In the revised manuscript, we now state, "To investigate the editing efficiency of Cas12a RNPs for another target, we selected the HPRT1 locus (Fig. 2e) ." Figure 3e , when the authors quantified the transduction efficiency of GFP by CPP-ELD peptide, it is not clear to me what the calculated transduction efficiency is referring to (ciliated cells? Goblet cells? Both?). Please clarify. It seems that cell-type specific antibodies were not used for this based on the image provided. What is the reason for this?", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
