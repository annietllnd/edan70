Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the maintenance of the telomere ends [19] , is upregulated in most cancers [20] and might play a role in aging [21] . Human telomerase is made up of a 451-nucleotide RNA, a reverse transcriptase, and other proteins [22] . At the 5â€² end of the RNA is a highly conserved pseudoknot, required for activity, which lies at the core of telomerase. The structure of the human telomerase pseudoknot reveals a classic H-type pseudoknot fold with a slight bend between the stems ( Figure 2C ) [5] . A triple-helix structure fl anks the junction of the helices and extends into each stem. Mutations within the telomerase pseudoknot have been directly linked to the diseases autosomal dyskeratosis congenita [21] and aplastic anemia [23] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
