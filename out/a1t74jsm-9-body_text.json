The four single gene trees are largely congruent and show previously established features like the monophyly of the genera Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia' [23, 37] . The split of Anaplasma species into two branches is also shown in the 16S rRNA, groEL and gltA trees, where all named Anaplasma species are represented [38] . Minor differences are observed within the exact branching order of species within the established clades, in particular for A. bovis [39] . Each tree firmly places the novel Anaplasmataceae microorganism on the branch leading to the Anaplasma clade [37] . The four gene sequences of the A. phagocytophilum isolate (MR-23) had 99.4% to 100% identity to the A. phagocytophilum genome sequence (GenBank NC_007797). The observed deviations from the reference genome sequence in the 16S rRNA gene (1 SNP) and gltA (2 SNPs) were shared with independent sequences of California isolates of A. phagocytophilum (AF172167, AF304137), suggesting that these differences are mostly likely unique to isolates from California.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
