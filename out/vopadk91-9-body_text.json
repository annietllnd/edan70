Determination of the sign of the E rev provides a quick estimation of the channel selectivity, that is, of its preference for cations or anions (51, 52) . By comparing the measured E rev to the theoretical E rev that would be obtained in the case of a neutral pore (i.e., representing only the difference between cation and anion intrinsic mobilities), the selectivity of the ion channel can be inferred. The theoretical E rev is calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, replacing the permeability ratio P ϩ /P Ϫ by the solution diffusion coefficient ratio D ϩ /D Ϫ (53). Higher, lower, or similar measured E rev values indicate anion selectivity, cation selectivity, or no selectivity, respectively. Interestingly, in the presence of monovalent ions (Na ϩ and K ϩ ), the protein 3a IC showed weak cation selectivity. However, in the presence of Ca ϩϩ , the channel behaved as a neutral channel with no preference for anions or cations (Table 1) . Taken together, these results indicated that at least Na ϩ , K ϩ , and Ca ϩϩ were conducted through the 3a protein IC.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
