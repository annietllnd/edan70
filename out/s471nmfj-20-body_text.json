We found that in the cells expressing VP1 (shown in Supplementary  Figure S1 ), the level of cyclin D1 remained unchanged, while and phosphorylated (at serine 780) retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb), which promotes the progression of G1 (Hassan et al., 2004) , was increased (Supplementary Figure S1A) . p21 and p53, the Cdk inhibitors (Scully et al., 2018) , were down-regulated (Supplementary Figure S1B) . Other Cdk inhibitors such as p15, p16, and p57 remained unchanged (Supplementary Figure S1B ). However, cyclin E level was decreased, while p27 Kip1 , one of the inhibitors of Cdks, was increased (Figures 3A,B) . These results suggest that cyclin E and p27 Kip1 play a key role for G1 arrest in the cells expressing VP1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
