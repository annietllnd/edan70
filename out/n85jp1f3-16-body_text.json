The most recent update to the international ethics guidelines promulgated by the Council for International Organizations of the Medical Sciences also simply states in its guidelines that risks should be minimized and justified by the benefits to society; however, the commentary underlying this statement indicates that there is some upper level of risk in research that cannot be justified. Notably, CIOMS draws this line of unacceptable risk by ruling out examples of research with extraordinary risks. The examples CIOMS provides of an unacceptable study are of HCTs: "[A] study that involves deliberately infecting healthy individuals with anthrax or Ebola -both of which pose a very high mortality risk due to the absence of effective treatments -would not be acceptable even if it could result in developing an effective vaccine against these diseases" [6] . This language seems to suggest that HCTs on many high-priority emerging infectious diseases could not be justified because of the high level of risk to participants.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
