These have also been referred to as ABACBC PKs, but like the core PKs, extended PKs can be embellished to any extent required (Text S2). A domain of RNA structure consists of a RNA sequence fragment that forms a stable isolated secondary structure independent of the remaining sequence on the 59 and 39 sides of the domain. In this respect, the fragment can be snipped out and folded without major changes happening to the structure. An example of such a domain is shown in Fig. 4b where domain 1 and domain 2 could be snipped out of the sequence and each structure would persist unaffected. When a pseudoknot joins these independent domains, the entire complex becomes a single domain (Fig. 4b) . The approach for extended PKs assumes that evolution has selected domains that are stable when formed during the folding process and do not change significantly even with the addition of pseudoknot interactions. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4b and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] . A pseudoknot becomes part of a subdomain when it is incorporated into other secondary structure (Fig. 4c ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
