It is also important to note that the necessity of glycans as host-cell invasion factors can vary greatly, and whilst a wide spectrum of viruses have been shown to interact with lectins, the majority of viruses, for example, HIV-1 [211] , arenaviruses [209] , influenza [218] , hepatitis C [219] , and coronaviruses [212, 220] , are recognised by host lectins on immune cells but do not utilise lectins as obligate receptors. However, as in the case of HIV, these lectin interactions have been shown to expand and enhance infectivity routes. A comprehensive table referencing viruses and associated lectin interactions can be found in the review by Van Breedam et al. [221] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
