This study further evaluated the influence of VP1 on cell cycle and revealed the underlying mechanism. To study the mechanism of the disturbed cell cycle, we determined the regulatory proteins associated with the control of G1 phase. We found that cells expressing VP1 showed up-regulated p-Rb, decreased levels of p21 Cip and p53. HeLa cells were transfected with si-Hsp70 for 24 h. Cell lysate was prepared and cyclin E, p27 kip1 , and Hsp70 were determined by Western blotting. (F) HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-VP1 for 24 h, HSF1 and p(S326)-HSF1 were determined by Western blotting. n = 3. * P < 0.05, * * P < 0.01, * * * P < 0.001.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
