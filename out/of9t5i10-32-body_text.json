Encapsulation of poly (ICLC) within cationic liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and stearylamine completely mitigated the toxicity (as determined by absence of weight loss and changes in body temperature) observed with free poly (ICLC) when administered i.v. [54, 105] . Liposome-encapsulation of poly (ICLC) did not reduce weight loss following i.n. administration, but it did reduce the magnitude and duration of body temperature reduction following influenza infection [105] . Liposomes have been shown to accumulate at sites of infection [15] , possibly concentrating the encapsulated drug at the diseased site and thereby minimizing the exposures of healthy organs and tissues to the drug, resulting in a gradual and sustained release of poly (ICLC), thereby avoiding rapid systemic elevation of drug levels observed with some routes of administration. It is unclear whether the significant reductions in the toxicity of poly (ICLC) provided by liposomes will result in corresponding decreases in clinical side effects seen in human patients.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
