For example, the Env glycoprotein from HIV-1 pseudoviruses exhibit unusually elevated levels of oligomannosetype glycans compared to those of infectious virus produced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [27] . This is likely due to deviations away from a native-like virus budding pathway in the pseudoviral system [3, 28, 29] . The cellular basis of these effects are not entirely clear; however, it is known that virus budding can compromise native membrane integrity [30] . If variations in budding routes are apparent in experimental systems, it is likely that virus biology, and its associated glycosylation, is heterogeneous in the setting of a native infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
