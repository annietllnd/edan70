Looking forward, a comprehensive approach to health will catalyse actions that protect the health of the region's people, animals and environment. This can be achieved with a regional One Health approach among the nations and permanent participants of the circumpolar north. Understanding the health risks of climate change in the Arctic will require scientists, policy makers, communities and public health experts to collaborate beyond the confines of their disciplines and borders, and One Health provides an approach to detect the emergence of climate-sensitive health threats in the region. As a shared regional approach, One Health can enhance disease prevention and resiliency for Arctic inhabitants.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
