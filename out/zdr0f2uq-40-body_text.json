A prominent example of anti-viral lectin activity includes oligomannose-type glycan recognition on HIV-1 Env by langerin, a C-type lectin expressed on Langerhans cells, which results in virus internalisation and degradation [240] . As such, it seems feasible that membrane-bound lectins constitute an important part of the innate immune response against other oligomannose glycan-bearing viruses, perhaps by also aiding in antigen presentation [241] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
