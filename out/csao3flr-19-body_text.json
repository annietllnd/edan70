First, HeLa cells were grown on glass slides as monolayers. Next, the pCDNA 3.1 vector expressing HA from H7N9-AH/H7N9-SH1 was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24 h post transfection, the slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS. The cells were then incubated with HNIgGA6 at 37Â°C for 1 h. Bound antibodies were detected with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Invitrogen) and were observed using a fluorescence microscope.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
