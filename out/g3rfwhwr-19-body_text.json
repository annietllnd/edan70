The genus Nairovirus, from the family Bunyaviridae, has seven species groups (or serogroups), including at least 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses [37, 38] . Like other members of this family, the viruses of this genus have a genome consisting of three segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA: the small (S), medium (M) and large (L) segments, encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) generating the mature glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) on cleavage, and the viral polymerase (L), respectively [39, 40] . Multiple reads and several large contigs (up to almost 4,900 nt in length) from specimens b8 and b9 (liver and lung pools from Myotis mystacinus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, respectively) strongly matched sequences from nairoviruses ( Table 3 ). All three genome segments were covered ( Fig. 3A and data not shown). For each segment, a comparison of overlapping nucleotide regions (up to 3,456 nt long) between b8 and b9 contig sequences showed complete nucleotide identity, indicating that the same nairovirus-related agent was present in those two bat species (data not shown). All individual bat tissue samples were screened by PCR for the presence of this virus, with a specific set of primers targeting a conserved domain of the polymerase sequence. Lung tissue samples from specimens b8 and b9 tested positive on the amplification and sequencing of the amplicons (Table 3 ). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this bat-related nairovirus diverged considerably from all other nairoviruses identified to date (Fig. 3B) . Thus, this virus, which we have named Ahun nairovirus, represents a putative new species of the genus Nairovirus, and the first bat nairovirus identified to date. Identification of a new bat rotavirus. Rotaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a segmented genome consisting of 11 double-stranded RNA segments encoding six structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and five to six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6) [41, 42] . Rotavirus A is one of the three main species (the others being B and C) of the genus Rotavirus, from the family Reoviridae. There are several types of virus in this group, associated with a large number of diverse animal hosts [41, 43] . We identified sequences from pooled samples originating from specimen b8 (Myotis mystacinus) that gave significant hits matching sequences from this group of viruses. In BLASTx and BLASTn analyses, most of these sequences matched four of the 11 viral genome segments ( Table 3 ). The presence of the VP1 and VP2 rotavirus related-sequences was confirmed in the lung tissue of specimen b8 by PCR with specific primers (Table 3 , Fig. 4A and data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial VP1 gene sequence demonstrated that this virus was more closely related to group A than other groups of rotaviruses (Fig. 4B) . However, this sequence was found at a basal position in the phylogenetic tree, very distantly related to those clustering in this group, even the viral isolate recently identified in a single lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) originated from China [44] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
