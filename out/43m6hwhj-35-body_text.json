Badaoui et al. [38] reported the activation of TREM1 signaling pathway in response to the infection with highly virulent East European PRRSV strain Lena (subtype 3 of Type 1). Similarly, an increase of activity in TREM 1 pathway was noted for ILI and BOR strains. Furthermore, in infection with Lena as well as ILI and BOR strains, the expression of IL-8 and TLR4 was upregulated. This finding could suggest common mechanism playing role in the infection with genetically different East European strains and their higher pathogenicity compared to classical PRRSV strains present in Central and Western European countries.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
