Briefly, serum samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C, and then 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared in a 50 μl volume of serum free MEM (V diluent) in immunoassay plates. The diluted sera were mixed with an equal volume of V diluent containing influenza virus at 100-times the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). After 2-hour incubation, the mixture was transferred to duplicate wells of MDCK cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates. After virus control wells exhibited an advanced virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE; 48 hours), the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of CPE, and staining with 1% crystal violet solution (1% formaldehyde and 10% methanol) for 15 minutes. Neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced CPE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
