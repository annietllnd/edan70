Measles virus and paramyxovirus (such as SeV and Nipah virus) V protein, and influenza virus NS1 protein inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by interacting with NLRP3, decreasing the secretion of IL-1β accordingly (64) (65) (66) . The interaction between viral proteins and NLRP3 prevents the selfoligomerization of NLRP3 as well as the recruitment of ASC, resulting in the block of NLRP3-dependent ASC oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome activation (66) . As a regulator of NLRP3 expression, the myeloid-specific microRNA miR-223 downregulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding within the 3 ′ untranslated region (UTR) of NLRP3 (67) . Under these conditions, EBV miR-BART15 specifically targets the miR-223 binding site in the NLRP3 3 ′ -UTR to inhibit NLRP3 activation (68) . miR-BART15 can also be transported around non-infected cells through exomes secreted from infected B cells, thereby amplifying this immunosuppressive state. PB1-F2, a viral virulence protein encoded by most IAV strains, could be spliced into different lengths (63) . Although PB1-F2 induces excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing apoptosis, the mediation of phagolysosome acidification or formation of PB1-F2 aggregates (22, 63) , it also could impair NLRP3 inflammasome activation through different mechanism (69). PB1-F2 distributes into the mitochondrial inner membrane space via Tom 40 channels and this mitochondrial location of PB1-F2 attenuates the mitochondrial membrane potential and as a result, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation (69) . These conflicting results may be attributed to the different secondary structures of PB1-F2 spliceosomes (70) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
