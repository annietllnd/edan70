Log transformation was applied to [RNA4/18S rRNA] dox-treated / [RNA4/18S rRNA] untreated ratios from Northern blot data, where 18S rRNA served as normalization standard. One-sided t-statistics were used to identify the dox-treated strains whose RNA replication was statistically significantly altered compared to untreated strains. p-values from t-statistics were converted to qvalues to control for false discovery rate [37] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
