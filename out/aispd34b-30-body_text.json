In these experiments, transgenic parasite lines use a var promoter to drive expression of a drug resistance gene rather than a PfEMP1 protein. Drug selection followed by cloning and analysis of resistant lines indicates that the transfected recombinant promoter is activated in these lines and that all other var promoters are silenced. There is disagreement as to whether a single active var promoter is sufficient to silence all other promoters [34] or whether the system of allelic exclusion requires both the 5' var promoter and a promoter located downstream in the var gene intron to interact in some way to silence transcription [43, 44] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
