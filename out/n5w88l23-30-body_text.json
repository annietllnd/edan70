However, in this study, dihydropyrimidinase supplemented with Co 2+ ions exhibited the highest activity ( Table 2 ). Due to the low bioavailability of cobalt on earth and in cells, we thought that the possibility of a biological role playing in dihydropyrimidinase may be ruled out. The higher activity of the Co 2+ -substituted enzymes has been proposed. The higher activity followed by metal replacement in Co(II)-thermolysin than in native thermolysin may be due to the enhancement of stabilization of the transition state than those of the native thermolysin [47] . For imidase, the sizes of the metal are found as the important factors that affect the activity of imidase [4] . The position of nucleophilic attack on an imide substrate may fluctuate due to size of the coordinating metal ion. Because the crystal structure of the Co 2+ -dihydropyrimidinase is still lacking, both these possibilities cannot be ruled out.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
