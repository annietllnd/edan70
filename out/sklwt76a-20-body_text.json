Although culture is considered a gold standard method (and was so considered in this study), colonial identification is challenging and subjective because it is done using the human eye and a dissecting microscope. Artifacts may be misidentified as colonies, yielding false-positive results, or colonies may be overlooked, yielding false-negative results. Although PCR may be considered more technically complex, in a laboratory where technologists are familiar with PCR, this approach is more user-friendly (and generalizable among assays for various microorganisms) than culture.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
