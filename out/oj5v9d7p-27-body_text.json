The molecular mechanisms of the vitagene network operation in various stress conditions have been recently reviewed [110, 164] , and the biochemical and physiological consequences of the upregulation of the vitagene network in cells and the organism as whole is an important direction of current research [12, 165, 166] . In accordance with the above reports, cellular stress response could be modified by vitagene activation leading to additional synthesis of various protective antioxidant molecules helping effective stress adaptation. The vitagene concept already found its acceptance in the medical sciences in relation to neurodegenerative disorders [107] , neuroprotection [109, 167] , autism [168] , dermatology [169] , osteoporosis and Alzheimer pathology [165, 166, [170] [171] [172] , schizophrenia [12] , free radical-related diseases [173, 174] , aging and longevity [108, 110, 175, 176] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
