Whereas the basal activity ensures cell survival, inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling results in apoptosis. For an infected organism, apoptosis represents an effective antiviral instrument which is simple but highly effective. Thus, in order to secure its own replication, the virus must prevent or delay apoptosis. This may be achieved by maintaining the basal stimulatory OPEN ACCESS activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Since disabling host cell apoptosis is likely to be an obligatory step in the viral life cycle [1] , regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by viruses is quite likely to have had a considerable evolutionary impact. In response to this viral hijacking of key cellular processes, the PI3K/Akt pathway appears to be involved in the host cell immune response as a form of "adaptive strategy" to counteract viral invasion. Thus, when apoptosis is blocked by the virus, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway induces expression of interferon-responsive genes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Nevertheless, as a large number of viruses rely on PI3K activity for their replication, there would appear to be a greater benefit for the virus in activating rather than suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
