The negative control for this experiment was serum free DMEM media, not PBS, and this is corrected in the revised Supplemental Figure 3 and Methods. The positive control, Triton-X100, was suspended in serum free DMEM media. There were no significant differences in LDH release between any of the experimental conditions except for the positive control. The reviewer is correct that materials were applied to the epithelial cells in a 50 Âµl volume for all conditions. We revised Supplemental Figure 3 , the figure legend, and the Methods section to improve the clarity regarding the technical aspects of these experiments.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
