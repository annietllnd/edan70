Toxicity of poly (ICLC) is affected by the route of administration with subcutaneous (s.c.) administration being tolerated well in rabbits [115] and mice (unpublished observations) and intratracheal administration being well tolerated in mice [116] . Intramuscular (i.m.), i.p., i.n. or i.v. administration results in variable levels of toxicity depending on the animal species and doses being used [54] . Mice given three i.n. doses of 100 Î¼g poly(IC) 24 hours apart demonstrated signs of lung inflammation (increased neutrophils in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid, increased cytokine levels, cellular infiltration in the lungs and decreased lung function), which was milder than the reaction seen in TLR3 KO mice [117] . In clinical trials, patients receiving multiple therapeutic doses of poly (ICLC), i.v. or i.m., exhibited serious toxic reactions including hypotension, fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, injection site inflammation and, in multiple sclerosis patients, neurological dysfunction [15, 109, [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
