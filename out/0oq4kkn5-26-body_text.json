For characterization and purity of the compounds in this article, see Supplementary Figs 4-29. Identity and purity (495%) of all compounds were determined by chromatography (silica or RP-18 HPLC), by fully assigned 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra and by high-resolution mass spectra. Protein assays were performed with recombinantly expressed viral proteases. Negative control sets (omission of protease), positive control sets (omission of inhibitor), and controls for autofluorescence of substrate or inhibitor were carried out and did not interfere with the assay readout unless noted otherwise. K M -and v max -values were determined by double reciprocal plotting of the measured activity against the concentration of substrate (Lineweaver-Burk). Enzyme kinetics were determined with a Fluorimeter SAFIRE II from Tecan (Crailsheim, Germany). Assays were conducted on polystyrene 384-microtiter plates from Corning (model 3,544).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
