Dietary methionine (Met) levels (2.00, 2.75, 3.50, 4.25, 5.00 or 5.75 g/kg for 24 weeks) showed a linear and quadratic effect on the gene expression of GPx1, HO-1 and Nrf2, and quadratically increased the activity of GPx and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver of duck breeders. Furthermore, maternal dietary Met enhanced the gene expression of GPx1, HO-1 and Nrf2, increased activity of GPX and T-AOC and reduced carbonylated protein in the brains of hatchlings [295] . Dietary probiotic Bacillus subtilis (Strain fmbj) was shown to increases antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of chicken breast muscle during storage. This was associated with increased mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, HO-1, SOD, CAT, GPx) and decreased the oxidative damage index (MDA, ROS, PC, 8-OhdG) in chicken breast muscle [296] and expression of Nrf2, HO-1, SOD and GPx in chicken liver mitochondria due to the dietary probiotic [297] . Furthermore, there is a range of other nutrients upregulating Nrf2 expression in different poultry tissues, including carnitine [90] , taurine [298] and silymarin [91] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
