The first step, known as the priming step, is induced by PRRs or TNFR activation. This leads to the activation of NF-κB and promotes the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. Additionally, IFNAR also activates the priming stage of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (6) . The second step, also called the activation step, is triggered by a range of stimuli that emerge during infections, tissue damage, or metabolic imbalances. Such stimuli include ATP, pore-forming toxins, crystalline substances, nucleic acids, and invading pathogens (7) . NLRP3 recruits ASC through its N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) by homophilic interactions, resulting in the formation of ASC prion-like oligomerizes (8) . The NAIP, CIITA, HET-E and TP1 (NACHT) domain in the middle of the NLRP3 possesses dNTPase activity and mediates downstream oligomerization (9) . The C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) associates with HSP90, SGT1, and PML and is considered to be responsible for the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity (10, 11) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
