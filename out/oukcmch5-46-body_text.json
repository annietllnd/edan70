Supernatant was removed and pellet resuspended in 200 ml TN buffer overnight on ice. Concentrated virus solution was subjected to further purification on a Pfefferkorn gradient (10-20%, 25-50%, 50% cushion). After spinning for 1 h at 150,000 rcf a clear virus band was visible. The virus band was collected and diluted in TN buffer. The virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 110,000 rcf for 1 h and resuspended in 200 ml 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.15M NaCl buffer pH 7.2 overnight on ice. The purified virus solution was labeled using DyLight NHS 488 (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infectivity of the labeled virus was confirmed by TCID50 analysis and qRT-PCR.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
