{"cord_uid":"nag4at49", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC3707868", "divid":4, "text":"To create the plasmid containing the Fc bait cassette, a codon optimized sequence of human IgG1 Fc fragment was synthesized using an EcoRI forward PCR primer containing the nucleic acid sequence of S. cerevisiae α-mating factor signal sequence fused upstream of the sequence encoding the IgG1 Fc N-terminus (DKTHTCPPC.), and a SalI reverse primer encoding the C-terminus of IgG1 Fc that terminates in a sequence encoding a GGGG linker. A plasmid containing the human IgG1 heavy-chain gene sequence was used as a PCR template for amplification of an EcoRI-α-mating factor signal sequence-Fc-GGGG-SalI fragment. Both PCR product and pGLY3033 [3] were digested using EcoRI and SalI endonucleases. The EcoRI-SalI fragment encoding the Fc was ligated in frame to EcoRI-SalI pGLY3033 backbone to generate plasmid pGLY9008. This plasmid enables delivery of the FC-ScSED1 cassette under the control of the Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter sequence. Like the parent plasmid, it contains the Pichia pastoris URA6 gene sequence, which serves as an integration locus in the genome, and the arsenite resistance gene, to allow selection on media containing sodium arsenite.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
