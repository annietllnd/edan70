MA104 cells were seeded at 1 ϫ 10 5 cells in 2-cm 2 wells onto sapphire discs and infected at an MOI of 75 FFU/cell. At 10 hpi, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4˚C and kept in that buffer overnight at 4˚C. Afterward, samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4˚C and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series starting at 70%, followed by two changes in acetone, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (60 to 80 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (47) . Samples were analyzed in a transmission electron microscope (CM12; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Ultrascan 1000; Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) at an acceleration of 100 kV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
