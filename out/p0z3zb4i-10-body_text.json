During the study period 766 ward-admissions of patients with rheumatologic/vasculitic/connective tissue autoimmune disease occurred. Among those there were 63 (8%) episodes of admission from 63 outpatients of our clinic presenting with respiratory deterioration that were ultimately diagnosed to be due to pneumonia or pneumonitis ( Table 1) . As a rough estimate one can infer an incidence of community-acquired respiratory infection or pneumonitis requiring hospitalization in outpatients with autoimmune disease of [63 patients * 100/(1400 patients *8 years)], i.e., ~0.5% per year.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
