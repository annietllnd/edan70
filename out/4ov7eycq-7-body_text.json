SGTA contains a noncanonical ubiquitin-like binding domain that interacts with Ubl4b, a component of the Bag6 complex. This interaction recruits SGTA to the Bag6 complex. It was suggested that the interaction of SGTA with Bag6 is required to promote the degradation of mislocalized proteins by ERAD 33 . In contrast, studies from High's lab showed that for degradation of mislocalized membrane proteins, SGTA competes with the Bag6 complex for cytosolic mislocalized membrane proteins (MLPs) and prevents the ubiquitylation of specific precursors 34 . When SGTA is overexpressed, the efficient removal of MLPs by proteasomal degradation is delayed, resulting in their increased steady-state levels and cytosolic aggregation 34 . In another report, Leznicki et al. showed that overexpressed SGTA binding to Rpn13, an intrinsic ubiquitin receptor of the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit, resulted in an increase in steady-state levels of MLPs due to escape from proteasomal degradation 35 . It has been reported that SGTA and its yeast homolog Sgt2 promote the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane by direct interaction with a hydrophobic substrate 36 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
