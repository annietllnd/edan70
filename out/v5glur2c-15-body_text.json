Five fields (magnification 100Ã—) within the proximal femur in each section were chosen. The first field was located at the approximate center of the femoral head at the ligamentum teres and the remaining four fields were located at the both sides of the first field. The mean of the five fields from each section was determined to represent that section. The mean of the five sections from each animal was taken as the value for that rabbit. The mean fat cells den-sity, mean fat cells size and fat cells area would be measured with imaging process software Image-Pro Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Fat cells density = marrow fat cells number in selected field/(selected field area -trabecular bone area); fat cells diameter = the total diameter of fat cells in selected field/the number of fat cells in selected field; fat cells area = the area of all fat cells in selected field/(the selected field area -trabecular bone area) [6, 15] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
