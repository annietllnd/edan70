Interaction with the viral receptor embedded within the host cell membrane activates and triggers a signaling cascade coincident with viral entry to set the stage for a favorable cellular environment for viral needs. For example, within a minute after HIV-1 exposure, more than 200 phosphorylation sites are modified in T-cells, with the potential to alter several cellular processes immediately after infection and thus to support viral replication [14] . Schematic drawing of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated through receptor-binding (receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), sidled blue line) by growth factors (GF) or cytokines (CY) resulting in phosphorylation of PIP 2 . PIP 3 subsequently serves as a second messenger allowing the binding of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins like Akt. Thereby the latter undergoes conformational changes leading to its phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt finally participates in the regulation of cellular processes like translation, cell growth and apoptosis by phosphorylating further proteins. Termination of the signaling cascade can either occur through the dephosphorylation of PIP 3 by the phosphatase PTEN or SHIP, or further downstream through the dephosphorylation of Akt by PHLPP or PP2A.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
