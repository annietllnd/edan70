Inhibition of Akt activity either by the pharmaceutical PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or by expressing a dominant-negative form of Akt reduces viral titers by up to 90%, corresponding to cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP as significant indicators of apoptotic cells [70] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
