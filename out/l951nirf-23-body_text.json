Collected lungs were homogenized for approximately 2 minutes using a hand-held tissue homogenizer (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) and centrifuged to remove debris. The supernatant was serially 10-fold diluted and transferred to MDCK cell monolayers in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 2 days at 37Â°C. The virus titer was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula and was expressed as log10 TCID 50 per milliliter.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
