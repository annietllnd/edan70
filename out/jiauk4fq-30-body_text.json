Figure 1 Fibrin microthrombi in pulmonary venules of animals pre-infected with BVDV and challenged later with BHV-1.1. Co-infected animals presented vascular alterations that facilitate the occlusion of the pulmonary venules as fibrin microthrombi observed with Fraser Lendrum technique (A) and TEM (B) at 4 dpi, as well as PIM enlarged and rounded engulfing cell debris (arrowheads) observed with TEM at 4 dpi (C). their response. Thus, the BVDV/BHV-1 group showed a higher number of these cells during the study, peaking at 4 dpi (p < 0.0001). The number of PAM was also significantly higher in the co-infected calves at the start of the study, showing a decrease from 4 dpi ( Figure 5 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
