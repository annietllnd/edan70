Human DCs that capture dead cells containing influenza virus produce cytokines, undergo maturation and expand CD4(+) T helper cells but fail to elicit CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell responses against antigens from the dead cells [51] . A recent study demonstrated that chickens infected with H9N2 strains were resistant to H5N1 influenza virus challenge. Protective immunity was closely related to the percentage of CD8(+) T cells expressing IFN-in the lung, rather than in the spleen, suggesting that pulmonary cellular immunity may be very important in protecting na√Øve natural hosts against lethal influenza viruses [52] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
