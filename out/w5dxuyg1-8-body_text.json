Six of the 16 cats with FIP had effusions, including three of the four experimental cases (data was unavailable for three animals). Group 1.2 consisted of 14 clinically healthy, male SPF cats that had been per-orally infected at an age of 8.5 to 27 weeks with previously isolated serotype I FCoV field strains of enteric pathotype (FCoVZu1, 2, 3, and 5 -feline enteric coronavirus; FECV) and had been euthanased between 2 and 12 weeks p.i. [34] . This experiment was performed under the Swiss regional legislation (project license number TVB 66/2000). All cats had tested positive for FCoV shedding and those euthanased more than 2 weeks p.i. seroconverted. All were confirmed to be systemically FCoV infected by the presence of a FCoV viraemia [34] . These cats were used as a comparison group to provide relatively uniform baseline cytokine level as pet cats without FIP would be subject to wide variations in terms of pathogen exposure, FCoV infection status, and concurrent disease. This also allowed evaluation of the effect of FIP on the animal rather than FCoV infection per se.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
