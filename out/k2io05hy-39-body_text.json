At 24 hours post-infection, NS4 formed small aggregates throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that it makes specific interactions with itself and/or other infected cell components ( figure 11A, 11B) . This is consistent with bioinformatic analyses which identified nuclear localisation signals in NS4 of GIV and BTV (as well as YUOV, PHSV, EHDV, AHSV).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
