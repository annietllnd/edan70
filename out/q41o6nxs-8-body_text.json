One Health is a particularly well-suited approach to advance the understanding of the constantly changing health threats resulting from the direct and indirect impacts of climate change in the Arctic. Specifically, an Arctic One Health approach can enhance surveillance capacity to monitor climate-sensitive health risks; advance a regional baseline understanding of the interaction between human and animal disease and disease vectors and increase the understanding of the relationship between climate changes and emerging of health risks and benefits.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
