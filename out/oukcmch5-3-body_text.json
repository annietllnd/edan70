They are capable of infecting a wide variety of mammalian and avian species. In most cases they cause respiratory and/or intestinal tract disease. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known as major causes of the common cold (e.g. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). However, the emergence of new HCoVs of zoonotic origin has shown the potential of CoVs to cause lifethreatening disease in humans as was demonstrated during the 2002/2003 SARS-CoV epidemics and more recently for MERS-CoV in the Middle East [17, 18] . The well-studied mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is often used as a safe model to study CoV infections.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
