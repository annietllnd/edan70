The cycloheptane shows only weak electron density indicating the flexible orientation of this part of the molecule at the protein surface, a van der Waals interaction is observed between the ring C4 atom and the side-chain C b atom of Ala-144. In summary, the crystal structure shows that the binding of compound 14 is distinct from that of the established inhibitors such as AG-7404 in several aspects that contribute to an understanding of the observed inhibitory activities. The modified warhead structure seems to favour binding through an additional interaction with the oxyanion hole and with the p-stacking of the pyrazolone. For comparison compounds 12 and 20 were docked to the enzyme and similar binding poses as in the crystal structure were obtained ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
