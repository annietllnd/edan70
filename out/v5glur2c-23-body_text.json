The number of adipocytes in ON + group was 270% more as compared with ONgroup, 120% more in MON group as compared with SON group(p < 0.05). The optical density results showed 210% more triglycerides formation in ON + group as compared with ONgroup, and 80% more in MON group as compared with SON group (p < 0.05) (Figure 4 ). Figure 2 Blood perfusion assessed by dynamic MRI for Maximum Enhancement and Time-Signal Intensity. (A) Maximum Enhancement at the examined sites (both proximal femora and distal femora, the similar pattern was found, data not shown here for distal femora) showed a significant decrease from baseline in ON + rabbits at week 2 after steroid induction. There were significant decrease in Maximum Enhancement between ON + and ONgroup, MON and SON group at week 2 (p < 0.05). (B) Representative Time-Signal Intensity curves from contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI on proximal femur. The Time-Signal Intensity curve showed a significant decrease in enhancement slope in ON + group as compared with ONgroup at week 2.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
