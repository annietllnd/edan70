SIV infection is characterized by fever, inactivity, decreased food intake, respiratory distress, coughing, sneezing, conjunctivitis, and nasal discharge. 1, 2 Disease severity is affected by many factors, including the viral strain, but typically, the onset of disease is sudden. The incubation period is between 1 and 3 days, with rapid recovery beginning 4-7 days after onset. The disease is characterized by high morbidity and generally low mortality rates. 3 Influenza A viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are 80-120 nm enveloped viruses with segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes. 3 The segmented genome of influenza virus allows reassortment between different viruses, and once cells are infected with two or more different influenza viruses, the exchange of RNA segments between the viruses allows the generation of progeny containing a novel combination of genes. 3 The viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the main targets of the host immune response, and they are important for host specificity and virulence. 4 HA binds to the cell receptor N-acetylneuraminic acid-2,3-galactose linkage or to the N-acetylneuraminic acid-2,6-galactose linkage on sialyloligosaccharides of avian and mammalian viruses, respectively. 5 Swine have been considered to be a potential 'mixing vessel' because they have receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses. 6 In 2009, a new influenza virus emerged in the human population of North America. Pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09), which has a unique genome with six gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, and NS) from the triple reassortant swine lineage of the North American virus and the M and NA gene derived from the Eurasian lineage of the swine influenza virus, 7 had never before been recognized in swine. Immediately after the spread of H1N1pdm09 in human populations, outbreaks in pigs were reported in many countries worldwide. 8 Brazil is the fifth leading global pork producer and the fourth largest pork exporter, and swine production is economically important. However, few studies have investigated the presence of SIV antibodies or virus isolates in Brazilian pigs. In Brazil, SIV was first isolated in 1978 in a pig from Minas Gerais state. 9 One study reported a low prevalence of antibodies against H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in pigs from 10 Brazilian states between 1996 and 1999. 10 Further studies demonstrated the prevalence of anti-influenza antibodies against human 11 and swine viruses 12 in southeastern Brazil. In a seroprevalence study in Paran a (southern Brazil), the authors reported that 46% of the sampled farms were positive for anti-H3N2 antibodies, and the prevalence of antibodies against human H3N2 in those pigs was 20%. 13 After the H1N1pdm09 outbreak, few studies reported the presence of influenza virus in Brazilian herds. 14, 15 However, no data are available concerning the prevalence of antibodies against swine influenza virus in Brazilian herds after 2009. In Brazil, a vaccine protecting swine against influenza virus was licensed on May 2014. Prior to that vaccine, the presence of anti-influenza antibodies in pigs was attributed to natural infection. Recently, there were many reports regarding respiratory outbreaks in farms around the country 16 and producers and veterinarians began vaccinating against swine influenza to reduce economic losses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
