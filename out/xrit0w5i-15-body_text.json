The IFITM1 CRISPER activating plasmid is a synergy activation medium (SAM) transcriptional activation system designed to specifically upregulate gene expression. According to instructions of products, we firstly prepared mixtures (2 μg plasmid and 7.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000) of plasmid and Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagents using Opti-MEM Media. Then cells were covered with the mixtures for 36 h at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The overexpression level of IFITM1 was detected by western blot at 36 h after transfection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
