Planar bilayers were formed by apposition of two monolayers prepared from a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) at a DOPC/DOPS/DOPE ratio of 3:1:1 (wt/wt) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) mixed in pentane at 5 mg/ml. Lipids were added on~100-m-diameter orifices in the 15-m-thick Teflon partition that separated two identical chambers (50, 77) ; the orifices were pretreated with a 1% solution of hexadecane-pentane. Aqueous solutions of KCl, NaCl, or CaCl 2 were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. All measurements were performed at room temperature (23 Ϯ 1°C). Ion channel insertion was achieved by adding 0.5 to 1 l of a 300 g/ml solution of recombinant protein in a buffer containing acetonitrileisopropanol (40:60) on one side of the chamber (here referred to as the cis side).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
