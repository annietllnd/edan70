During a spillover event into a new host species, any of these host interactions (or all of them) that don't function correctly in a new host would be predicted to drive virus evolution. At the most basic level, our study has shown that RanBP2 is not functionally equivalent between species, and therefore has the potential to act as a selective force driving evolution of the SIV capsid. This is also likely to be true for TRIM5α, which is highly host species-specific in its interactions with lentiviruses [29, 30] . However, MxB, CPSF6, and CypA are not likely to drive capsid evolution as lentiviruses move from one primate species to the next. This is because these three host proteins are predicted to function identically between primate species with respect to lentiviral interactions, for the following reasons. First, the capsid binding domain in CPSF6 is perfectly conserved between primate species [26] . Second, the CypA protein sequence has remained unchanged during~30 million years of primate evolution (S3 Fig). Third, MxB is under positive selection, but there is no overlap between these variable residue sites and those mapped to dictate lentiviral restriction [31] . Therefore, interactions between lentiviruses and the CPSF6, MxB, and CypA proteins are predicted to be equal in all primate species. It seems reasonable to conclude that the evolution of the cyclophilin-binding loop in capsid during spillover is primarily driven by TRIM5α and RanBP2, but not the other factors known to interact with this loop.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
