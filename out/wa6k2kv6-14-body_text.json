Continuously distributed variables were compared between FLU-A-positive ILIcases and FLU-A-negative ILI-cases using the Student's t-test (t) if data was normally distributed and the Mann-Whitney U test if nonnormally distributed. Categorical data or proportions were compared using Pearson's x 2 or Chi-square test. In order to evaluate the association between each variable and the FLU-A-positive cases at a univariated level, continuously distributed variables were recategorised into binary variables, and univariate analysis using x 2 allowed calculation of odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. P values,0.05 were considered statistically significant.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
