(a) Proteintemplated, covalent assembly of an irreversible inhibitor of a cysteine protease: reversible binding of a nucleophilic fragment (Nu ¼ nucleophile) to the S1-site (step 1) positions the bis-electrophilic warhead 1 in a templated dynamic reaction at the active site of the protein (step 2), leading to irreversible inhibition of the protein (step 3). In the case that Nu is an amine nucleophile (Nu ¼ NHR), an imine intermediate instead of the depicted hemiaminal may be formed. (b) The active site of an enterovirus 3C protease with a bound peptide substrate containing a glutamine residue (Gln, Q) in P1 position occupying the S1 pocket of the enzyme.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
