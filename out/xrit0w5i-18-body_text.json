Here we used Real-Time PCR and western blot to quantify the levels of IFITM1 induced by virus infection or viral particle inoculation in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs. Results showed that both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 1 ). Compared to virus group, viral particle inoculation induced higher levels of IFITM1 at the mRNA level at 24 h and at protein level at 36 h (P < 0.05, ANOVA) in HUVECs (Fig. 1a-c) . In contrast, H9N2 virus infection induced higher expression of IFITM1 at mRNA level at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h (P < 0.05, ANOVA), and higher levels of IFITM1 protein at 6 h, 12 h (P < 0.05, ANOVA) in BEAS-2Bs ( Fig. 1d-f ). Our data showed that H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation induced different kinetics of IFITM1 expression in/ between HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
