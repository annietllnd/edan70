Children in our study that were never breast-fed had higher risk of caries, which was consistent with existing literature [49] [50] [51] . Breast milk by itself was not cariogenic [52] , but the reported cariogenicity of certain infant formulas [53] and a higher risk associated with practice of breast feeding until late infancy (> 12 months -OR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.35-2.95) [54] should not discourage the practice of mixed feeding until the emergence of new evidence. Interestingly, children in our study that were exclusively breast-fed also experienced higher risk of caries, rendering support to the practice of mixed feeding. As noted in previously published literature [54] , it is possible that the practice of breast feeding until late infancy could have played a role in excess risk observed in Saudi children; however, further research based on a larger sample is warranted to confirm our findings and determine the role of duration of exclusive breast feeding on caries risk among children in Saudi Arabia.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
