NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a complex process which gives rise to multiple phosphorylation states ranging from the most abundant 28-kDa phosphoisoform up to the hyperphosphorylated 32-to 34-kDa states (19, 20) . All of these forms have been found to be more stable in viroplasms, while chemical disruption of viroplasms results in NSP5 dephosphorylation (21) . The mechanism of NSP5 phosphorylation is not yet wholly understood, but it involves interactions with other viral proteins. When expressed alone in noninfected cells, NSP5 is not phosphorylated, while coexpression with NSP2 or VP2 results in NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) (8, 22, 23) . NSP5 hyperphosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of serine 67 (Ser67) by casein kinase 1␣ (CK1␣) to initiate the phosphorylation cascade (24, 25) , and it is considered to be essential for the assembly of viroplasms (26) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
