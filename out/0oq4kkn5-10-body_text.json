This inactivation rate corresponded to an apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 4 41 mM after 10 min (Fig. 2b , Table 1 ). The covalent mode of action was confirmed by electrospray ionization high-resolution ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements. Incubation of the protease with warhead 1 shifted the main deconvoluted mass peak of the protein from 21,471.5 to 21,588.5 Da and the observed protein mass difference of 117 Da corresponded well with the molecular weight of bis-electrophile 1 after hydrolysis of the ethyl ester.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
