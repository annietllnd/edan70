Thirty farms (F1 to F30) from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata, Triângulo Mineiro/Alto Parana ıba, South/Southwest and the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area) were selected for this study ( Figure 1 ); these farms represented approximately 2Á4% of all herds in the state. All sampled farms were registered with the agency responsible for the state health surveillance. The number of farms was calculated based on the premise that each repetition has a maximum weight of 3Á33% in the sample, 17 and the response was expressed as a percentage. At each farm, blood samples were randomly collected from 20 animals in each production cycle category: breeding animals (sows and gilts), farrowing crate (2-3 weeks), nursery (4-7 weeks), grower pigs (8-14 weeks), and finisher pigs (15-16 weeks) . In total, there were 100 samples per farm and 3000 animals in the study. All farms were farrow-to-finishing operations, with no SIV vaccination history, and most farms utilized allin-all-out production systems. The farms had between 160 and 1950 sows, and three farms had experienced respiratory disease outbreaks with swine influenza diagnostic confirmed between 3 and 6 months prior to the sample collection. This study was conducted under the approval of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais ethics committee. All herd owners provided consent for the use of the sera.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
