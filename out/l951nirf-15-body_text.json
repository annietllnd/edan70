Purified VLPs were adsorbed by flotation onto a freshly discharged, 300 mesh formvar/ carbon-coated copper grid and allowed to dry completely (Ted pella, Redding, CA, USA). The grids were rinsed with buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 120 mM KCl, negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and then dried by aspiration. VLPs were visualized on a JEM-1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 80 kV, and were digitally captured with an ES1000W Erlangshen CCD camera (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA).
