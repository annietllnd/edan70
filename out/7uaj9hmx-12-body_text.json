Experiments assessed ROS production in resting cells, as well as in a group of cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to determine the effects of the various stimuli under basal conditions in these cells, as well as when they were activated. MDMs were infected for 2, 4, 12, or 24h (m. o.i of 0.5) or uninfected (uninfected control). The same treatments were performed on macrophage stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (1Î¼g/mL LPS from E. coli O26:B6 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA). MDMs were exposed to 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe oxidized to highly fluorescent 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) by ROS. Fluorescence intensity, proportional to ROS levels within the cytosol was measured using a SpectraMax M2e microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) reading at 480 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
