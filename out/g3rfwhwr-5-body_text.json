Total RNA was then extracted according to the manufacturer's protocols. In addition, a final step of purification was performed for RNA extracted from brain using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). All RNA were eluted in 30 ml of RNase-free water and stored at 280uC until use. They were then subjected to reverse transcription followed by amplification with the wholetranscriptome amplification (WTA) protocol (QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome kit, Qiagen), as previously described [30] . The WTA products obtained from the various organs collected from a single bat specimen were pooled (mixing of equal volumes) before sequencing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
