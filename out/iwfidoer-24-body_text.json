In the present study, FLDS enriched the viral RNA reads by > 300-fold that with total RNA-seq (Table 2) . Notably, FLDS produced significantly more ssRNA viral reads than total RNA-seq; however, FLDS only has the ability to detect ssRNA viruses at the replicative stage. Moreover, FLDS showed more uniform read coverage than RNA-seq. These results indicate that FLDS is more effective than total RNA-seq for revealing all RNA viruses in cellular organisms.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
