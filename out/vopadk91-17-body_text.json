In order to study the interdependence of SARS-CoV viroporins, all possible combinations of single-, double-, and triple-deletion mutants were engineered (Table 3 ). All combinations were efficiently rescued, with the remarkable exceptions of the triple mutant [rSARS-CoV-MA15-Δ(3a,E,8a)] and the one lacking both E and 3a proteins [rSARS-CoV-MA15-Δ(3a,E)]. The ΔE virus and double-deletion mutants Δ(3a,8a) and Δ(E,8a) showed significantly reduced titers (1 ϫ 10 6 , 2 ϫ 10 6 , and 6 ϫ 10 5 PFU/ml, respectively) compared to the Δ3a and Δ8a mutants and the parental virus. Although a role for protein 8a was not 16- week-old BALB/c mice were subjected to mock infection (PBS, gray filled squares) or infected with 100,000 PFU of the parental (wild-type) virus (WT; black filled hexagons) or of genetically engineered mutants lacking the 3a protein (Δ3a, green filled circles) or lacking the protein 3a PBM (3a-PBM Ϫ , red filled diamonds). Mean levels of weight loss (left graph) and survival (right graph) through 10 dpi are represented for each group. Data summarize two replicate experiments with equivalent results. Error bars represent the standard deviations of mouse weight data. described for virus replication, the titers of viruses missing 8a and 3a or E were significantly lower than the titers of Δ3a and ΔE viruses. Also, every one of the viable mutant viruses which lacked either 3a or E proteins showed plaque sizes that were significantly smaller than those seen with the wt and Δ8a viruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
