Unexpectedly, the ATF4 target genes, GADD34 and CHOP, are not detected during MHV infection, which may correlates with the persistent phosphorylation of eIF2α and sustained suppression of host protein synthesis [36, 45] . The MHV induced translation inhibition coincides with degradation of host mRNA. The formation of stress granules and P bodies, the sites of mRNA stalling and degradation respectively, are detected in MHV-infected LR7 cells [102] . MHV infection also leads to RNase L-independent specific 28S rRNA cleavage in all susceptible cell lines, which may contribute to MHV induced translational inhibition [103] . Although MHV infection induces protein synthesis inhibition, the viral proteins are still efficiently made, which can be attributed to the 5 1 -leader sequence and N protein in viral mRNA or the abundance of viral mRNA. MHV replication is not negatively affected either in the host translational shutoff-deficient (eIF2αS51A) MEF cells or stress granule impaired (TIA-1´/á nd TIAR´/´) MEFs, suggesting the translational inhibition is not beneficial for virus replication in vitro [102] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
