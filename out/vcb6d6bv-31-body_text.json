In a recent work, Kawano et al. [98] propose that monomeric M2 protein first dimerize through interactions between the amphipatic helix of two monomers. No implication of the TM domain is required at this point. According to the authors, once formed, the dimer is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys17 and Cys19. The dimer is stable at neutral pH, however at acidic pH (eg. endosome) cation-Ï€ interactions between protonated His37 and Trp41 induce the formation of the tetramer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
