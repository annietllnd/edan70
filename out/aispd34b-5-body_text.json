Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is a group of variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, thus enabling the parasite to sequester in various endothelial tissues of the host and avoid clearance in the spleen [1, 2] . Several receptors have been identified as mediators of the sequestration, e.g. CD36 [3] , thrombospondin [4] and ICAM-1, associated with cerebral malaria [5] and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), the main receptor in the placenta and associated with pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) [6] . PfEMP1 are encoded by the highly diverse var gene family and each parasite genome harbours ~60 of these genes [7] [8] [9] . The var gene repertoire of the 3D7 parasite [10] can be sub-grouped into three major groups (A, B and C), two intermediate groups (B/A and B/C), and the var1csa and var2csa sub-families based on promoter regions and chromosomal locations [11, 12] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
