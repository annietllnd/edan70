To test this, we used our well-established VP40 VLP budding assay to determine whether expression of BAG3-WT, BAG3-ΔN or BAG3-ΔC would affect VP40 VLP egress. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transfected with eVP40 or mVP40 alone, or in combination with either BAG3-WT, BAG3-ΔN or BAG3-ΔC, and both cell extracts and supernatants containing VLPs were harvested at 24 hours post transfection (Fig 5) . All proteins were detected at equivalent levels in cell extracts (Fig 5A and  5C Cells) . Interestingly, we found that expression of BAG3WT or BAG3-ΔC consistently resulted in a significant decrease in egress of both eVP40 (Fig 5A and 5B ) and mVP40 (Fig 5C and 5D ) VLPs. Importantly, we did not observe a significant decrease in egress of either eVP40 or mVP40 VLPs in the presence of WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-ΔN (Fig 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2; Fig 5C, compare lanes 1 and 3) . Intriguingly, the inhibitory effect of BAG3 appeared to be more pronounced on budding of mVP40 VLPs (Fig 5D) , compared to that on eVP40 VLPs. This may reflect the presence of a single PPxY L-domain within mVP40 in contrast to the presence of overlapping PTAP and PPxY motifs within eVP40.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
