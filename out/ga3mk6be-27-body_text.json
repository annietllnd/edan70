It was also evident that in BSR cells BTV-8 expresses lower amounts of NS4 relative to BTV-1 ( Figure 4D and not shown). However, BTV-1 replicates better than BTV-8 in these cells and differences in the steady-state levels of VP7 between these two viruses were also observed ( Figure 4D ). In cells infected by BTV1-DNS4 or BTV8-DNS4, we found by electron microscopy all the ultrastructural features of BTV-infected cells (e.g. viral inclusion bodies, NS1 tubules, viral particles) ( Figure 4E ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
