Specifically, surveys were more likely to happen in the community (30.1%) or universities (29.8%), whereas interventions were predominantly conducted in hospitals (40.5%) or community health centres (27.0%). Accordingly, community-based residents and university students (medical or non-medical) were the most common participants in MHL surveys, while patients with mental disorders, carers and health professionals were more common participants in MHL-related interventions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
