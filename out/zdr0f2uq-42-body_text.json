The ability of HA to recognise and bind specific glycan moieties via the receptor binding site has led to it being regarded as a viral lectin [249] . The binding event between HA and its glycan receptor leads to the endocytic internalisation of the virion, subsequent pH-dependent viral-endosomal membrane fusion, and the infection of the target cell. Remarkably, cross-species transmission is determined by preferential binding of HAs to glycan receptors with a single change in sialic acid linkage to the penultimate galactose residue; Neu5Ac-α(2,3)-Gal that is primarily expressed in bird and pig gastro-intestinal and respiratory tract cells or Neu5Ac-α(2,6)-Gal that is the predominant structure found in human upper respiratory epithelial cells [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] . Sialic acid and host glycan recognition is not limited to influenza viruses; many pathogens such as paramyxoviruses [102] , rotaviruses [255] , noroviruses [256] , polyomaviruses [257] , and coronaviruses [258, 259] also possess glycoproteins with sialic acid binding capabilities that facilitate host cell entry. Glycans recognised by viruses are not solely presented on glycoproteins. These glycan epitopes can also be found on glycolipids, which are composed of oligosaccharides linked to ceramide lipid molecules, and widely found on host-cell surfaces [260] . Furthermore, interactions between glycolipids on the viral envelope and cellular receptors have been implicated to contribute to viral pathogenesis, for example sialyllactose-containing glycolipids on the HIV-1 viral membrane can be bound by siglec-1, a lectin found on dendritic cells, to mediate trans-infection of T cells [261] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
