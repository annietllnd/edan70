Briefly, late-stage trophozoites were obtained by gelatin purification and washed twice in RPMI1640. The infected erythrocytes were then incubated for 0.5 hour at 37°C with VAR2CSA-DBL5εspecific rabbit antiserum and washed three times with medium to remove unbound antibodies. Infected erythrocytes expressing VAR2CSA were isolated by the use of protein G-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen) on a MACS magnet (Miltenyi Biotec). The suspension of infected erythrocytes and beads was washed three times and added to a culture flask with 4% haematocrit of uninfected erythrocytes in 5 ml culture medium. After 24 hours, the beads were removed by magnetic separation. This was repeated until parasites specifically expressed VAR2CSA on the surface. Expression of the VSA PAM phenotype was confirmed by specific binding of parasites to CSA in static binding assays and exclusive recognition of the surface of the infected erythrocytes by antibodies from women exposed to P. falciparum during pregnancy. This was done by flow cytometry using a panel of serum samples from P. falciparum-exposed men and women and non-exposed Danes as described [29, 30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
