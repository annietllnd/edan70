The control of cell cycle ensures the faithful replication and segregation of the genome (Fan et al., 2017) . The unidirectional progression of cell cycle is controlled by the periodic activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The activity of Cdks largely depends on their partnership with specific cyclins in the distinct phase of cell cycle. In mammalian cells, cyclin D, cyclin A/E, and cyclin A/B couple with Cdk4/6, Cdk2, and Cdk1, respectively, to coordinate the transition between distinct cell cycle stages (Sanchez and Dynlacht, 2005) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
