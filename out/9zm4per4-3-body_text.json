Viruses utilize pseudoknots for mimicry [5, 6] and frame shifting [7] [8] [9] . An understanding of RNA folding and dynamics is likely to speed up the discovery of critical targets that aid in the rapid development of vaccines in the case of a pandemic [10] and can help model the structure of unknown non-coding RNA sequences that comprises a large fraction of the human genome [11] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
