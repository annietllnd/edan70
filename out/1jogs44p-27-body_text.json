For example, CNVR7655.1 and CNVR7656.1 were found in 5% of the CEU (U.S. residents with northern and western European ancestry) populations, but not in the YRI (Yoruba from Ibadan in African) populations. On the other hand, CNVR7657.1 was unique to YRI populations (15%). By contrast, the CNVR3825.1 that encompassed PSG4 is specific to ,80% of East Asians (ASN, pooled samples of Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
