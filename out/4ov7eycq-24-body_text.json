We tested if the accumulation of the non-glycosylated tetherin species in the presence of SGTA is due to inhibition of the ERAD pathway. We used shRNA to deplete Bag6, a central component of the ERAD complex 45 . As shown in Fig. 7A , Bag6 depletion is highly efficient. In Bag6-depleted cells, the 23-kDa tetherin species is observed at levels similar to those in cells transfected with non-target shRNA. Thus, we can conclude that Bag6 is not required for SGTA-mediated stabilization of non-glycosylated tetherin. We also inhibited the ERAD pathway by treating cells with kifunensine, an ERAD inhibitor 46 . Kifunensine is an alkaloid compound that suppresses ER-associated mannosidase I activity 47 . Tetherin is modified with high-mannose oligosaccharide side chains in the ER; these are trimmed by the mannosidase I enzyme and modified to complex side chains in the Golgi 48 . Mannose trimming from the N-glycans is also essential for targeting misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD 49 . In the presence of kifunensine, there is a reduction in highly glycosylated tetherin, indicating that the compound is active. However, kifunensine treatment did not increase the levels of the 23-kDa tetherin species. Further, kifunensine had no effect on the SGTA-mediated stabilization of non-glycosylated tetherin (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 6 and Fig. 7C) , suggesting that accumulation of the non-glycosylated tetherin species is not a result of inhibition of ERAD by SGTA overexpression.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
