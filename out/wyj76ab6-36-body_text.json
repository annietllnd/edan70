In addition to hand washing, PVP-I preparations may have other applications in reducing the spread of EBOV, as they are not limited to use on intact skin but can also be administered to the mucosa of the mouth, nose, eye, urinary and genital tract [36, 37] . Treatment of these potential entry points for EBOV and other viruses may not be appropriate for other preparations, such as more highly concentrated alcohol-based products.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
