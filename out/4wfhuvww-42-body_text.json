It is likely that a combination of computational, experimental, genomic, and proteomic methods will be needed to determine the entire frameshifted proteome, as required to understand fully gene expression in any organism. We need to identify the frameshift motifs that enable frameshifting, as well as all the genes that produce out-of-frame peptides. Finally, as a low level of frameshifting can be considered "biological noise," we need to determine the physiological relevance of these frameshifted proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
