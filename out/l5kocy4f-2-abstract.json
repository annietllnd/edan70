We have identified BAG3 as a novel and functional host VP40 interactor that negatively regulates VP40 VLP and virus egress in a PPxY/WW-domain dependent manner. As a cell survival protein and key regulator of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), BAG3 sequesters EBOV and MARV VP40 away from the site of budding at the plasma membrane, and thus may represent a novel host defense strategy to combat filovirus VP40-mediated egress and spread.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
