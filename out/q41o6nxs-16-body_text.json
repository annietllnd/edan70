For Arctic inhabitants, with deep cultural connection to the environment, the associated health risks to humans, animals and the environment are increasingly apparent in everyday life. Currently, we lack a full understanding of these risks to humans, animals and the Arctic environment. Now it is the time for a new comprehensive perspective of climate change impacts on Arctic health. One Health is a transdisciplinary approach ideally suited for addressing health issues in complex systems such as the Arctic. The One Health approach promotes collaborative approaches to the collection, analysis and interpretation of a wide range of data to anticipate and respond to the rapidly changing environment and its health impacts on human and animal communities. A One Health approach can provide critical lead time and early warning of impending dangers while stimulating more innovative collaborative intervention options for prevention and response.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
