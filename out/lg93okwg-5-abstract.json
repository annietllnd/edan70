To shed some light on the essential role of FLASH in 3'-end processing of replicationdependent histone pre-mRNA processing [3], we carried out structural studies on the human FLASH N-terminal domain (NTD) encompassing residues 51-137 using X-ray crystallography. We also performed biophysical studies on the FLASH NTD and the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex to characterize their oligomeric states and the stoichiometry of their complex.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
