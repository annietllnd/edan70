Detection of CMV antibodies is effective for systematic screening for CMV infection [2] . For instance, the CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assay can help to distinguish primary from non-primary human CMV infections [3] [4] [5] . The key immune methods used for CMV antibody detection are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6] , Elecsys [7] , electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) [8] , immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [9] , flow cytometry (FCM) [10] and immunoblots [11] . Additionally, new immune methods for CMV antibody detection have been developed, such as the chemiluminesent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) [12] and protein microarrays [13, 14] . However, these methods suffer from inherent limitations, such as length of testing time, the needs for expensive equipment, specialist skills, low sensitivity, and complicated sample preparation processes. For example, conventional ELISA is still the main diagnostic test for CMV, and commercial CMV ELISA Kits are available. Although ELISA is often used as a comparison method for CMV antibody detection [13] , obvious shortcomings include the need of tracer label, plate washing, the indirect format of detection, and the length of time necessary for testing. Thus, a rapid, simple, direct, and high-throughput method for CMV antibody detection is urgently needed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
