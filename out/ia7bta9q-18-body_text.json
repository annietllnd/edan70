Although quite some distance to the polymerase active site, the interactions with the MTase domain may modulate the movement of the fingers domain 5-stranded b-sheet that has been documented to undergo subtle rigid body movement upon active site closure for RdRP catalysis [12] . Beyond that, the presence of the MTase domain only partially shields the top-right corner of the NTP entry channel, leaving the template channel and dsRNA channel unaffected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
