After 8 h of infection cells were collected and GFP expression by the replication of MHV was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As controls siRNAs silencing GFP and negative-control siRNAs were used. A hit from the screen was considered as confirmed when transfection with at least two out three independent siRNAs resulted in significant reduction in MHV-driven GFP expression relative to the negative-control siRNAs. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of ACTR2 and ACTR3 resulted in reduced infections for all three siRNAs, indicating that actin branching is important for MHV infection ( Figure 1A , dark orange). Also the importance of the RAB7A, RAB7B and VPS39 proteins, involved in late-endosome and late-endosome to lysosome maturation, for MHV infection could be confirmed ( Figure 1A , turquoise and light green). The importance of SNX1, VCL and PAK1 for infection of HeLa cells with MHV could not be confirmed ( Figure 1A , grey). The latter three genes were not studied any further. To validate our transfection protocol and confirm the efficacies of the siRNAs at the mRNA level, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed. All siRNAs used reduced the corresponding mRNA levels with 75-95% ( Figure 1B ). siRNAs targeting RAB7A were shown to inhibit the expression of a RAB7a-fusion protein ( Figure S1 in Text S1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
