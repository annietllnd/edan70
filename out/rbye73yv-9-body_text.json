Polyclonal by nature, the antibody response in vivo mobilizes a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that work in concert to target various antigenic domains on the viral envelope glycoprotein. Identifying the neutralizing mAbs that constitute the neutralizing activity of polyclonal response and their recognized antigenic domains has therefore become the first crucial step towards gaining a better understanding of the protective antibody response, developing clinical intervention methods, and designing immunogens capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
