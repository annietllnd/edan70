However, because the pseudotyped virus particle entry assays may be overly sensitive, an accurate assessment of the in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 using live H7N9 viruses is still needed. This is especially necessary since mutations on other genes besides HA are also associated with viral replication capacity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. The E627K mutation in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene enhances H7N9 replication in mammals 44 . The K526R mutation in PB2, which was identified in a HPAI H7N9 (A/Taiwan/1/2017) strain, also contributes to improve replication efficiency together with 627K 45 . The NA R292K mutation confers resistance to both oseltamivir and peramivir 46 . Nevertheless, based on genetic and phylogenetic analyses, the WHO has recommended that H7N9-AH may serve as a viable vaccine candidate for broad protection against H7 47, 48 . A comprehensive survey of common resistance mutations among the many strains tested here suggests that mAb HNIgGA6 may be a useful template for a therapeutic antibody.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
