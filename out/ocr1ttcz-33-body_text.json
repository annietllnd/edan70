In this study, we utilized MTase as a novel approach to attenuate VSV, since mRNA cap methylation will diminish viral protein translation which in turn would diminish viral replication 45, 46, 70 . We chose rVSV carrying a single point mutation in the SAM binding site (rVSV-G1670A) as a backbone which was specifically defective in G-N-7 but not 2′-O methylation 45 . If necessary, we can choose mutations (such as K1651A and D1762A) in MTase active site lacking both G-N-7 and 2′-O methylation, which will further enhance the safety of the VSV vector 46, 70 . We showed that recombinant rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E were significantly more attenuated in mice than wild type expressing the same ZIKV genes. Particularly, a dose of 10 5 PFU of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice whereas rVSV-prM-E-NS1 still caused mortality. In addition, we found that co-expression of NS1 with prM-E offered the additional benefit of further VSV attenuation. In all cases, prM-E-NS1 constructs were significantly more attenuated than prM-E constructs in mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
