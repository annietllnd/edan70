Next, we asked which residues of Vpu are required for the SGTA-mediated increase in non-glycosylated tetherin levels. Vpu is an oligomeric type I integral membrane protein with a hydrophilic, highly basic domain projecting from the cytoplasmic membrane face 40 . This basic patch (Vpu residues R30, K31, and R34) has previously been implicated in Vpu binding to SGTA 27 . We mutated all three of these basic residues, either together (RKR-AAA) or individually (R30A, K31A, R34A). We co-expressed tetherin and SGTA in the presence of WT or mutant Vpu in 293T cells. As shown above, in the presence of SGTA and WT Vpu, high levels of non-glycosylated tetherin were detected (Fig. 4C , lane 1). In contrast, in the presence of the RKR Vpu mutant, the non-glycosylated tetherin species did not accumulate (Fig. 4C, lane 2) . Of the three individual basic residue mutants, R30A was the most defective in its ability to increase non-glycosylated tetherin expression (Fig. 4C, lane 3) . The triple mutant was also partially defective in its ability to degrade the glycosylated forms of tetherin, (~30-36 kDa) compared to the non-phosphorylated Vpu mutant (SS-AA) 3 (Fig. 4C ). However, unlike the RKR-AAA triple mutant, all single mutants down-regulate the highly glycosylated tetherin species (Fig. 4C) . Because of its inability to degrade tetherin, the RKR-AAA triple and SS-AA mutants were unable to rescue virus release in the presence of tetherin (data not shown). The expression of all Vpu mutants was comparable to, or higher than, that of WT (Fig. 4C ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
