Briefly, rabbit antisera raised against NS4 of BTV-8 or GIV and a mouse anti-alpha tubulin antibody were both diluted 1/500 in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBS-A) and applied to the fixed cell. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature (RT), slides were washed in PBS, then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse, both diluted 1/250 in PBS. After labelling with primary and secondary antibodies, the cells were stained with DAPI (1:10,000) for 15 ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
