However, Japan has experienced a steady increase in the number of imported cases, mainly from South and Southeast Asian countries [15] [16] [17] . Despite only sporadic abundance of Aedes aegypti, the species Aedes albopictus is widespread across Honshu Island and all western parts of Japan, theoretically allowing for chains of dengue transmission to exist [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Dengue was eliminated in the country by 1945 and transmission has not been observed for 70 years [24] ; however, a German traveler visiting Japan in the summer of 2013 was later diagnosed with DENV2 infection upon returning to Germany [25] . In 2014, autochthonous transmission was confirmed in metropolitan Tokyo [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , resulting in a large outbreak involving a total of 160 confirmed cases, a shockingly high incidence for a previously dengue-free nation. It is now recognized that Japan is indeed at risk of dengue outbreaks during the summer season, indicating that a certain risk exists for the summer Olympic Games in 2020. This threat requires concrete planning for possible countermeasures in the event of another outbreak.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
