A time course of the proteolysis revealed that all four samples are cleaved to S1 and S2 products at equivalent rates at similar sites ( Supplementary Fig. S9 ). Nearing the end of the time course additional lower molecular weight bands are observed which we interpret to be degradation of the S1 subunit. Regardless of whether wild-type or prefusion-stabilized S was used or whether ACE2 was bound to the S ectodomains, there is no prominent band that corresponds to a S2â€² cleavage product (approximately 52 kDa).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
