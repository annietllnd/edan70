Historically, viruses are most often recognized as pathogens (38) , and, thus, have been studied in the field of medical and crop science. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled us to identify not only viruses associated with diseases, but also those present in natural environments including oceans (41) and soil (12) . Although these sequencing technologies have opened a new era in virus identification (24) , a limited number of methods have been established for virus enrichment and library construction. The diversity and distribution of viruses in non-viral nucleic acid-dominant environments, such as the intracellular environments in which viruses actually replicate, still remain unclear due to technical difficulties (16) . The development of a new procedure for effective virus enrichment and library construction is required in order to understand the full spectrum of diverse viruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
