Representative images are shown with arrows highlighting the typical localization pattern of GFP-eVP40 at the plasma membrane and in PM projections, while arrowheads highlight the altered diffuse cytoplasmic localization pattern of eVP40 observed in BAG3 expressing cells. Cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue. Scale bars = 10μm. B) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-eVP40 (green) plus mCherry-LC3 (red) and vector alone (top row), or BAG3 (bottom two rows), and cells were imaged at 24 hours post transfection using a Leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope. Representative images are shown with white arrows highlighting the colocalization of GFP-eVP40 and mCherry-LC3 in aggresomes. Cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue.
