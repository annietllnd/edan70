Moreover, modification of socioeconomic factors requires time-consuming macro level changes. In contrast, individual factors, such as child oral health behaviors, child feeding practices, and dietary habits that play a role in cariogenesis, could be targeted for modification by directing the limited resources to primary school children. Prior evidence illustrates the importance of adopting good oral health behaviors such as regular brushing of teeth, using mouthwash, and flossing teeth in reducing the disease burden and attaining optimal oral health [10] . Similarly, the role of sugary foods (e.g., candies) in cariogenesis was also well established [11] . However, the relative significance of aforementioned oral behavioral factors on cariogenesis compared to other host factors could vary significantly in different populations owing to cultural and behavioral practices.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
