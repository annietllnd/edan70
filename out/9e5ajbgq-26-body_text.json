This notion was further supported by the relatively stronger associations observed between individual factors and dental caries experience in our study. In contrast, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from developing nations demonstrated the dominant role of socioeconomic factors in dental caries' experience [18, [27] [28] [29] . The risk profile of dental caries among children in Saudi Arabia appears to follow the theme in developed world, where oral health behavioral practices and dietary habits were relatively more important [30] . However, efforts directed at improving socioeconomic status should be continued, owing to evidence from the present study and prior studies that identified maternal education and family income as consistent associated factors for dental caries [16, 17, 27, 28] . In addition, the availability of dental coverage in medical insurance was associated with dental caries. Although literary evidence was inconsistent in Saudi Arabia [16] , the alarming proportion of children (77%) that lacked dental coverage in medical insurance warrant further attention.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
