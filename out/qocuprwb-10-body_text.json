This is considered to be a reproducible model of natural human infections following the bite of an infected mosquito or tick and in the past, death was used as an index of pathogenesis [46] . However, it is known that peripheral infections with some strains of encephalitic flaviviruses do not exhibit normal dose response curves based on mortality. Although this was first reported in the 1940's [47] , the reason for these apparent discrepancies were not fully understood. We previously showed that the Oshima strain of TBEV caused dose independent mortality and the fatality rate did not increase more than 50% with increasing virus challenge doses from 10 2 to 10 6 plaque forming unit (pfu) [48] . In our study of TBEV, we suggested that the variation of fatal outcome in individual mice appeared to be due to variation in individual host responses [48] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
