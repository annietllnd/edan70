The ZIKV genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved posttranslationally into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 11, 12 . The E protein is a type II fusion protein which mediates cellular attachment and membrane fusion, and is the target for most neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Flavivirus prM protein typically associates with E to form heterodimers and is important for proper folding of E [13] [14] [15] [16] . Co-expression of prM and E of several flaviviruses including ZIKV results in the secretion of virus-like particles (VLPs) termed recombinant subviral particles [17] [18] [19] . The prM protein is an integral part of both virions and subviral particles, and undergoes a cleavage event during virus maturation 20 . Therefore, prM and E proteins have been the primary targets for the rational design of subunit and recombinant flavivirus vaccines. However, the NS1 protein of several flaviviruses has been shown to confer protection against flavivirus infection in animal models in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibody [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Whether immunization with the ZIKV NS1 protein has similar protective capabilities is currently unknown.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
