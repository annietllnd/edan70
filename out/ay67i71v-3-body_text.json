The majority of pilgrims develop one form of respiratory tract infection or another during their stay in Makkah and Madinah [4] . Various adverse conditions like overcrowding, extreme climatic condition, pollution, shared accommodation characterize these pilgrimages. Similarly, most of the pilgrims are older people (>50 years) with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and liver diseases [5, 6] .
