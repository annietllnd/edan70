IL-1β and TNF-α may also contribute to the hypoalbuminaemia and weight loss seen in FIP via decreased albumin production and increased muscle breakdown respectively [8, 44] . Adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production by endothelial cells (EC) is induced by TNF-α and IL-1β, leading to leukocyte binding [45] . In line with this, upregulation of β2-integrins was seen on leukocytes from cats with FIP [4, 46] . The cytokines can then be expected to contribute to the destruction of the vascular basal lamina seen in FIP phlebitis [1, 3, 4, 47] , as they upregulate matrix metalloproteinase secretion from monocytes [48, 49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
