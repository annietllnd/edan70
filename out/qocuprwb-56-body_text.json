Cytolytc leukocytes such as CD8 + T cells induce cytopathology during some encephalitic flavivirus infections [28] [29] [30] and these leukocytes kill virus-infected cells using two distinct mechanisms viz., Fas and granular exocytosis which involve perforin, granzyme A and B [61] [62] [63] [64] . In TNF-α KO mice, we showed that the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines including Fas and the granular exocytosis correlated with severe encephalitis and fatal outcome. However, in WT mice, the apparent immunopathological features were not observed in dying mice 13 days pi. Although it was difficult to identify dying and surviving mice before 13 days pi by their clinical signs, JaOArS982-infected mice showed varying levels of Fas and granular exocytosis in the brains at 11 days pi and some of them exhibited similar or higher levels compared with the TNFα KO mice ( Figure S3D ). Thus, fatal cases may exhibit severe encephalitis caused by immunopathological responses during the early phase of infection and thereafter severe clinical signs may appear in some mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
