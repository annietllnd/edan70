After soaking in piranha solution (30% H 2 O 2 :98% H 2 SO 4 = 1:3, vol/vol) for 30 min to increase the number of silanol groups on the wafer surface, and rinsing with deionized water and ethanol, the wafers were soaked in a mixture of 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (APTES) and absolute ethanol (APTES:absolute ethanol = 1:10, vol/vol) and incubated for 2 h with gentle agitation. The reaction of APTES with the surface silanol groups resulted in covalent immobilization of-O-Si(OH) 2 -(CH 2 ) 3 -NH 2 , forming a layer of densely packed amino groups on the surface. After rinsing three times with absolute ethanol, the wafers were incubated in a saturated solution of succinic anhydride in ethanol for 3 h with gentle agitation. The CH 2 CH 2 COOCO-group of succinic anhydride reacted with the -NH 2 of -O-Si(OH) 2 -(CH 2 ) 3 -NH 2 group immobilized on the surface, generating carboxyl groups (-(CH 2 ) 3 NH-CO-(CH 2 ) 2 -COOH). Once prepared, the wafers were stored in ethanol.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
