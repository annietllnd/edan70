The origin and relatedness of different virus families is currently a subject of active discussion. It is unclear whether viruses have evolved by reduction of genes from cellular species, whether they descended from mobile elements of other organisms or whether they precede cellular life and are ancient self-replicating units. Possibly, all of these hypotheses are true, for a subset of viral families [1] . The recent discovery of giant viruses [2, 3] revived this discussion with suggestions that a certain clade of giant viruses may represent a fourth domain of life [4] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
