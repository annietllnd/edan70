Various members of the genus Mastadenovirus have recently been shown to circulate widely in bats [16, 18, 20, 21, 77] . In particular, bat adenoviruses have been isolated from fecal samples of Myotis species in China and were detected in various tissues (including lungs and liver) collected from German bats belonging to the species Pipistrellus pipistrellus [56, 57] . Some of the reads and contig sequences of specimen b6 identified were found to be related to those of bat adenoviruses. Our results confirm that members of this virus family circulate widely in bats species, and that their potential spill-over transmission to other vertebrate species, including humans, merits further investigation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
