Compared other methods, the absolute sensitivity of BIE can reach 0.01 IU/mL, and it has good resolution in the range of 0.1-1.0 IU/mL on the calibration curve for quantitative detection. The reference range for detection of CMV antibodies has previously been published. For example, Elecsys (Roche Diagnostics) immunoassays have an equivocal range (0.5-1.0 IU/mL) of CMV IgG [12] . In our experiment, ELISA as a control method had a reference range of 0.4-0.6 IU/mL. Therefore, the sensitivity of our BIE biosensor is below the reference range and has already reached clinical standards.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
