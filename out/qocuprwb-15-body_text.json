B6 background IL-10-/-mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, USA [50] . TNF -/-mice were kindly provided by Yoichiro Iwakura, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science [51] . These mice were mated in the facility of Nagasaki University. Five to six week old mice were subcutaneously inoculated with a range of 10 0 -10 6 pfu of JEV diluted in EMEM containing 2% FCS. Mock infected mice were inoculated with EMEM from the supernatant medium of BHK cells. Mice were weighed daily and observed for clinical signs including behavioral symptoms and signs of paralysis. Thirteen days post infection (pi), dying and recovering mice were distinguished by the degree of weight ratio, and namely mice exhibiting more than 25% or less than 10% weight loss were recognized as dying or recovering mice, respectively.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
