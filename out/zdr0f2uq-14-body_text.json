ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, bind to this substrate glycan to sequester the glycoprotein in the ER such that the protein is able to properly fold. Once correctly folded, the chaperones are released and alpha-glucosidase II cleaves off the final glucose residue; if the glycoprotein at this stage is properly folded, it is processed further and exported to the Golgi apparatus for further modification. Conversely, if the glycoprotein is incorrectly assembled, it is re-glucosylated by UDPglucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), resulting in the glycoprotein being chaperoned once more. This feedback loop acts as a quality control mechanism ensuring that solely correctly folded glycoproteins exit the ER.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
