Modifications have included the use of lower molecular weight molecules and thiolation. In rabbits, a low molecular weight poly (ICLC) induced high IFN responses and ameliorated hypotensive responses, however, it also induced high fevers [115] . Optimal antiviral and antiproliferative activities were observed when thiolation of the five position of the cytosine base on the poly (C) strand was at 7.4% [138] . These results suggest that further study into modification of poly (ICLC) may be advantageous for the elimination / reduction of toxic side effects.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
