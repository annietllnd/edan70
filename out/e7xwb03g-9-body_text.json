The DENV nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database using key words ("Dengue virus"[porgn:__txid12637]). 2. A blastx homology search was performed to detect nucleotide regions that corresponded to each mature DENV protein; nucleotide regions that exhibited more than 85% sequence coverage to the protein were used for the subsequent analysis. 3. To reduce the time required to obtain the most homologous sequences in the genotype database, we reduced the number of sequences used in the blast search by clustering highly homologous sequences. We performed a uclust search (Edgar, 2010) against the nucleotide sequences of each protein region and selected one representative sequence for each homologous sequence group with a clustering threshold of 99% identity; then, the representative sequences were subjected to a homology search against the genotype database. The original genotype database was constructed according to the method proposed by previous report (Yamashita et al., 2013) . Briefly, the representative sequences were aligned by using the mafft (Katoh and Standley, 2014) program and Neighbor joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA5 program (Tamura et al., 2011) . The genotype of each gene was assigned manually according to the previous genotype database (Yamashita et al., 2013) . 4. Sequence ID, country/region and year of collection were extracted from the deposited GenBank data and integrated into the SQL database by using an in house Perl script.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
