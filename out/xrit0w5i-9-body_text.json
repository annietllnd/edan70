To detect the effect of HA and NA (Sino Biological) on the mRNA expression of IFITM1, HUVECs or BEAS-2Bs were divided into control group, low concentration group, high concentration group. Cells in control group were inoculated with free media, cells in low and high concentration groups were respectively treated with 0.1 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL HA or NA [35, 36] . RNA in each group used for Real-Time PCR analysis was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) at 6, 12 and 24 h after treatment. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer and a superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on the cDNA for RNA quantitation using Ex TaqMix (Takara Bio) and Eva green (Biotium) for IFITM1. GAPDH was amplified in parallel with the target genes as an endogenous control and all samples were analyzed in triplicate. The fold changes of specific mRNA from different groups compared to control group. The primer sequences were used as follows: GAPDH, F (5′ to 3′):", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
