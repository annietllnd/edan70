In brief, the intestine was flushed with cold PBS with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin), cut into 2mm segments, and washed with cold PBS with antibiotics until the supernatant was clear. The washed intestinal pieces were suspended in 15 ml of Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (STEMCELL, Canada) and shaken at 100 rpm for 25 min to disassociate the crypts at room temperature (RT). The pellets of the intestinal pieces were suspended in 10 ml of cold PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibiotics (Pen-Strep) and passed through a 70-µm cell mesh. The crypt pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 200 × g at 4 • C for 5 min and resuspended in 10 ml of cold DMEM/F12. After counting, the intestine crypts were resuspended in 25 µl of IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium (STEMCELL, Canada) and 25 µl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) per 50 crypts and seeded into a 48-well plate at 50 crypts per well. The plate was incubated at 37 • C for 10 min until the Matrigel solidified. The plate was filled with Complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium and then incubated at 37 • C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The culture medium was exchanged every 3-4 days. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute approved all the protocols related to the animal experiments performed in this study.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
