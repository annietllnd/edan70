Viral infection initiates NF-κB signaling through the activation of PRRsdependent pathways (24, 25) . RLRs, as cytosolic RNA sensors, detect viral RNA, such as VSV and IAV (26, 27) . TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 participate in the sensing of IAV, HCV, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) (21, 27, 28) . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), IAV and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) activate TLR2 or TLR4 in macrophages (29) (30) (31) . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection could be detected by cGAS, a major cytosolic DNA sensor (32) . Research indicates that HIV can prime NLRP3 inflammasome transcription in monocyte-derived macrophages (33) . Moreover, PRRs induced IFN-β and TNF-α that could, in turn, activate NF-κB and provide the cascade amplification necessary for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This response enables the host to defend effectively against viral infections.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
