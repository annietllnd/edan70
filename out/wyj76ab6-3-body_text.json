EBOV disease has a fatality rate of up to 90 %, and there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently available [1] , although Phase I clinical trials with the most advanced Ebola vaccine candidates started in autumn 2014 [3] [4] [5] . Current treatment includes general care to support vital organ functions, including fluid replacement therapy, kidney dialysis, blood transfusions and plasma replacement therapy [2] . In the absence of EBOV-specific treatments, efficacious disinfectant and antiseptic products are useful to help prevent the spread of infection [6] . In addition, hygiene measures, such as wearing gloves for any contact with blood and body fluids, medical masks and goggles or face shields have been identified as very important to protect against EBOV transmission.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
