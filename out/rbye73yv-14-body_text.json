One group immunized rhesus macaques with combined DNA and protein vaccines and isolated a panel of mAbs, including JC57-11, JC57-13, JC57-14, and FIB-H1, targeting both RBD and non-RBD S1 region of the S glycoprotein, all with potent neutralizing activities [50] . Another group immunized llama with recombinant RBD and screened the nanobody library for high-affinity single heavy chain antibody [61] . These nanobody-derived mAbs are smaller in molecular weight and more stable than traditional antibodies, and may provide a new option for future antibody isolation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
