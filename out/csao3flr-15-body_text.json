The retrieved full-length HA amino acid sequences of influenza A H7N9 viruses were aligned with the reference sequences available in the GISAID database (http://platform.gisaid.org/) by "Clus-talW" using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) version 7. Multiple alignment sites with gaps in any of the sequences were excluded. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the maximum-likelihood method in MEGA7 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The constructed phylogenetic trees were analyzed for possible geographical linkages.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
