The averaged GP values for the intracellular membranes of IFITM1 and 3-epxressing cells were also increased, albeit not statistically significant from those of mock controls (p = 0.08,0.37) (Fig. 8E) . Unfortunately, we have been unable to distinguish the lipid order of endosomal membranes from that of total intracellular membranes in this analysis. Noticeably, IFITM2 exhibited modest increases in the GP value (p = 0.1388) (Fig. 8E) , which correlated its less inhibitory effect on syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) . The increased lipid order in cells expressing IFITM proteins was also evidenced by their longer FLIM lifetimes as compared to those of mock controls and MbCDtreated cells (Fig. S6) . Collectively, these results showed that overexpression of IFITM proteins dramatically increases the lipid packing order of cell membranes and makes them less fluid and possibly less competent for membrane fusion (see below the Discussion).
