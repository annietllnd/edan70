The details of these methods have been revised in the Supplemental Information under the heading "Quantitative cell and tissue morphometry". Details regarding co-localization of GFP with cell type specific markers are provided in the Supplemental Information under the heading "Immunohistochemistry". We included the epithelial cells of the small and large airways in our analysis. Of note, we saw no cell types other than epithelial cells showing evidence of GFP expression. When Cas9 RNP was delivered without an amphiphilic peptide, we saw no GFP expression in mouse lung tissue sections. We now include representative photomicrographs of the large and small airways from a ROSA mT/mG mouse that received Cas9 RNP with no peptide (Figure 4g, h) . 7 . The authors showed that CPP-ELD peptide administration did not lead to any toxicity in mice. However, there is no data on the off-target effects of this delivery method. I would suggest the authors to include some data on off-target effect in the revised manuscript.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
