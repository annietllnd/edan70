An extracellular unstructured short domain (residues 1-24) involved (in the case of influenza A) in the incorporation into the virion [85] . 2. A TM domain, residues 25-46. This region is responsible for both tetramerization and proton conductance [86] . 3. A cytoplasmic membrane proximal amphiphilic helix involved in budding, scission and membrane localization [84, 87] . 4. A Ct disordered tail necessary for M1-M2 interaction [88] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
