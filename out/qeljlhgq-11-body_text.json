In each selected district or city, the SDAH of the corresponding province selected one LBM for sampling. LBMs were selected on the basis of (i) size (at least six vendors), (ii) source of birds (within the district for small-scale LBMs, outside the province for large-scale LBMs), and (iii) no inclusion in H7N9 surveillance activities. Small-scale markets were defined as markets which draw birds from within the same district and/or province. Sampling should therefore capture/represent the local circulation of HPAI. Largescale markets were defined as markets which draw birds from outside the province and therefore capture/represent the national and/or regional circulation of HPAI.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
