U. urealyticum was the only Ureaplasma species until 2002, when U. parvum was described [4] . The two are not distinguished based on culture characteristics alone. Real-time PCR detection of these microorganisms from clinical samples circumvents technical issues related to culture and shortens turnaround time for detection and identification.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
