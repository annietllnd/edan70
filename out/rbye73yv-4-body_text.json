In particular, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the Spike glycoprotein are major areas of focus due to its critical role in mediating viral entry, and its potential in inducing protective antibody responses in infected individuals. So far, more than twenty monoclonal antibodies with nanomolar neutralizing activities have been reported and many vaccine candidates are underway in preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we aim to capture the current advances and discuss possible strategies to translate these discoveries into an ultimate medical intervention against MERS-CoV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
