RNA integrity, purity, and concentration were assessed using an RNA Analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples passing quality control were analyzed on Illumina mouse WG-6 v 2.0 expression BeadChips in the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility Gene Expression Core. Expression data were analyzed using Excel and MATLAB, where fold change was calculated and converted to log 2 . Heatmaps and hierarchical clusters were derived using Gitools v2.2.2.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
