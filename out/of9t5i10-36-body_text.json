Mice given one lethal dose 50 (LD 50 ) of the virus had a 50% survival rate whereas those given two doses of liposome-encapsulated poly (ICLC) had a 100% survival rate. When the virus dose was increased to 4 LD 50 , survival of treated mice decreased to 63% whereas the untreated mice succumbed to infection [54, 106] . This demonstrates that non-specific immune stimulators may be an effective prophylaxis against a pandemic strain of influenza.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
