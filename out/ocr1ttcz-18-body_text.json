We found that spleen cells from mice that had been intranasally immunized with rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and restimulated in vitro with ZIKV E protein, increased the number of T helper cells (CD3 + CD4 + ) (Fig. 3a) . This finding indicates that immunization induced ZIKV E-specific T cells capable of proliferation after re-exposure to the E antigen.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
