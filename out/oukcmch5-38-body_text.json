With the exception of possibly IBV, cleavage at this position does not appear to occur in the virion-producing cell as it is not observed in released virions, but in the target cell (this study; [40, 43, 47, 48] ). This suggests that receptor binding or other environmental cues are necessary to render the cleavage site accessible for proteolysis in the intact virion. Also for several other viruses, including RSV [13] and Ebola virus [16] , cleavage of the fusion protein upon endocytosis has been shown to be required for entry. Our results furthermore show that cleavage at a FP-proximal position is an important determinant of the intracellular site of fusion. The question remains, however, why some CoVs evolved to fuse in early endosomal vesicles while others require trafficking to lysosomes. In view of the growing number of proteases that have been shown to cleave CoV spike proteins [97] , this question should probably be studied in relation to the proteolytic enzymes available in the CoV target tissues and cells in vivo.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
