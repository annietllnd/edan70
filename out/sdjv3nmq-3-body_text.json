Here we determined upstream MKKs of IBV-induced JNK activation and characterized its involvement in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis. We found that IBV infection activated the MKK7/JNK/c-Jun pathway in two mammalian cells (H1299 and Huh-7). IBV-induced JNK activation was mediated by MKK7, and required both its ATP binding and phosphorylation sites. We also showed that JNK-promoted apoptosis during IBV infection, and this activity was not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of Bcl2. Taken together, our data demonstrate an important pro-apoptotic function of JNK during coronavirus infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
