In the first step, the association between each characteristic of study sample and the presence of dental caries was evaluated using univariate logistic regression analyses; all the variables that were significant at p value less than or equal to 0.05 were selected for second step of analyses. In the second step, the associated factors for dental caries among each of the four broader determinants of health, including socioeconomic factors, child oral health behavior and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary factors, were identified based on four separate stepwise logistic regression analyses. Subsequently, the covariates that were significant (p â‰¤ 0.05) in each of the four analyses were selected for further analysis. In the final step, a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on covariates selected from step two and variable age group of the child (6 or 7 or 8 years) to determine key associated factors for dental caries. In addition, multicollinearity was assessed using collinearity indices, eigenvalues, and variable decomposition proportions for all the multivariate models. One of the highly collinear variables was removed giving precedence to children oral health behavior and practice covariates. In addition, Firth's bias correction was applied to the final multivariate model to address potential issues due to small sample size, and complete or quasi-complete separation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
