Therefore, clinicians should pay attention to other drugs catalyzed by CYP3A, especially those substrates with a narrow therapeutic range such as cyclosporine A, to avoid possible clinically significant interactions with GA [82] . Some studies revealed that the area under concentration-time curve and the mean retention time of methotrexate (MTX) were significantly increased by GA, which increases the adverse reactions of MTX [83] . MTX is an antifolate agent, anticancer agent, and immunosuppressant and is commonly used for anticancer chemotherapy [84] , rheumatoid arthritis [85] , and severe psoriasis [86] . The adverse reactions of MTX include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatotoxicity [87, 88] . A case report showed that combined administration of GA and cilostazol caused pseudoaldosteronism [89] . Therefore, the concurrent use of GA with MTX or cilostazol is not recommended. One report shows a case of hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis secondary to chronic GA intoxication [90] . GA ingestion could therefore potentially aggravate hypokalemia in patients with chronic laxative abuse [91] , indicating that the use of GA in hypokalemia should be treated with caution.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
