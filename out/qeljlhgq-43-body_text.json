Vaccination has been used to control HPAI in Vietnam and may have contributed to the spatial and temporal variation in risk, 4 | Posterior mean coefficients, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of spatial and non-spatial conditional autoregressive models of market days positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (Vietnam, 2011 (Vietnam, -2015 as vaccine coverage has been found to vary with both district and season (35) . In addition, the predominant duck breeds may vary between regions and vaccine response of different breeds of domestic ducks to the commercial vaccines has been shown to differ, resulting in shedding continuing in some clinically unaffected, vaccinated ducks (36) (37) (38) . Additional market level factors not included in the model have the potential to contribute to between-market variation in the likelihood of a sample testing positive for H5N1 or H5N6. Factors include the number of days per week the market opens, biosecurity measures, length of holding of birds in the LBM, number of birds and stocking density in the LBM, biosecurity, and husbandry on farms producing the poultry for sale (39, 40) . Collection of further market level information would enable further improvement of understanding of both H5N1 and H5N6 epidemiology in Vietnam.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
