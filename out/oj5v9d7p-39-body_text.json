At low or intermediate intensity oxidative stress, additional adaptive mechanisms leading to enhanced antioxidant potential are related to MAP-kinases and other kinases (e.g., protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) participating in signal sensing and orchestrating cellular response with enhanced antioxidant potential [251] . Furthermore, emerging evidence clearly indicates that Nrf2 can interact with other transcription factors, including heat shock factor (Hsf1; [253] ) to create additional options for AO system regulation. The Nrf2 stress pathway communicates with mitochondria, the main source of free radicals in biological system, to control cellular homeostasis during oxidative stress [254] . Based on the chemical structures, at least 10 classes of Nrf2 activators can be established, including diphenols, Michael reaction acceptors, isothiocyanates, thiocarbamates, trivalent arsenicals, 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones, hydroperoxides, vicinal dimercaptans, heavy metals and polyenes [255] . There is also a range of endogenously produced signalling mediators (e.g., H 2 O 2 , NO, fumarate, products of lipid peroxidation) effectively activating Nrf2 [255] . Currently, a number of natural and synthetic Nrf2-activating compounds have been described, and there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of Nrf2 activation in various stress conditions [204] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
