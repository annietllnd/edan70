However, to identify the dominant transcript in a parasite population it is critical to perform the analysis on ring-stage parasites when transcript levels peak. The findings that a highly homogeneous parasite population transcribes essentially one var gene at all time points and that the var2csa gene, a group B var gene and a group C var gene are all expressed as correctly spliced transcripts at all intraerythrocytic stages suggest that previous reports of promiscuous transcription of many var genes in a single parasite might represent experimental artefacts resulting from the presence of heterogeneous parasite populations.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
