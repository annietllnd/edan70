All ticks tested were adults with the exception of 126 nymphal ticks collected in Sonoma County. All ticks were visually pre-identified as I. pacificus, and the species was confirmed in 96.9% of the ticks tested by the detection of the Rickettsia endosymbiont of I. pacificus [10] . No ethical clearance was required to conduct research on invertebrate ectoparasites. All samples were submitted by private collectors or collected by county vector control agencies from locations that did not require specific permission. These studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Ticks were either alive, frozen, or ETOH preserved prior to DNA extraction using a modified Qiagen column-based protocol described previously [28] with the substitution of the Qiagen DNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for the Qiagen Virus MinElute columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A negative extraction control consisting of lysis buffer was included with each set of extractions and carried through the analysis to monitor for potential contamination.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
