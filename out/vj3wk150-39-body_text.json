The translational control constitutes one aspect of cellular antiviral response, and it is targeted and subverted by various coronaviruses at different levels via different mechanisms. It is hoped that further studies on these subjects will promote a more complete understanding of corovirus-host interactions and shed light on the development of antiviral therapeutics.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
