Following fixation, sections were taken for histopathology from the right and left cranial lobes, left caudal lobe and the middle accessory lobe. Representative photographs from slides of the left caudal lobe are shown in figure 5 . The ferrets in the control group had intact bronchiolar walls with very minimal infiltration by neutrophils with the exception of the left caudal lobe from control animal 2206 sacrificed on Day 1. Possible causes of this pattern of change may be an underlying systemic vasculopathy which is typically confirmed by evaluation of other organs that were not collected (e.g., kidney, spleen, liver).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
