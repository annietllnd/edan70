The ancestral allele at rs8110904 was found in 99% of CEU populations whereas the derived allele was found in 100% of ASN populations (Table S6 in File S1). On the other hand, the derived allele of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM8 (rs8103051) and PSG11 (rs10414166) were unique to YRI and CEU populations, respectively. The SNP rs12610545 in CEACAM18 was unique to Eurasians (Table S6 in File S1). Likewise, analysis based on the CEPH-HGDP project (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain-Human Genome Diversity Panel; 944 unrelated individuals from 52 populations) [58, 59, 60] showed that nonsynonymous SNPs in PSG4, CEACAM1, CEACAM18, and CEACAM21 are among those with the highest population differentiation in world populations (Fig. S5 in File S1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
