It is well established that the plasma membrane protein CD4 is downregulated by Vpu at least in part through a proteasomal degradation pathway 7 , more specifically by ERAD 43 . We expressed CD4 in 293T cells in the absence and presence of Vpu and SGTA. Unlike tetherin, CD4 was degraded by Vpu to a similar extent in the presence and absence of overexpressed SGTA (Fig. S3 ). This result also suggests that overexpression of SGTA does not interfere with ERAD, at least for the substrates tested.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
