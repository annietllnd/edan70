One of the most important antiviral cytokines in the host is interferons (IFNs), which perform key roles in inhibiting viral infection (1, 2) . The IFN family is categorized into three different types: type I IFN (IFN-α/β), type II IFN (IFN-γ), and type III IFN (IFN-λ). Type II IFN, which is primarily produced by T cells and natural killer cells, exerts limited direct antiviral activity and plays a key role in modulating the host immune response (3) , whereas type I IFNs (α/β) and the more recently discovered type III IFNs induce a strong antiviral state in responsive cells and play crucial roles in controlling viral infection (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Although type I IFNs have generally been thought to be a key element against systemic infections, recent research has shown that IFN-λ plays a critical role in mucosal infections, such as enteric infection (9, 10) . Unlike type I IFNs that are secreted by a wide range of different cell types upon stimulation, type III IFNs are primarily produced by epithelial cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) (8, (11) (12) (13) . IFN-λ acts primarily on the mucosal epithelium, which might result in fewer side effects compared with type I IFN treatment (8) . These features make IFN-λ a potentially superior antiviral therapeutic candidate against local mucosal infection (7) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
