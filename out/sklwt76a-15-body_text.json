The 14 discordant results were tested at Albany Medical Center; [12] five of nine specimens that were PCR positive/culture negative were PCR positive, and all five specimens that were PCR negative/culture positive were PCR negative. Of the specimens that tested positive for Ureaplasma species by PCR and were culture positive, U. urealyticum alone was detected in 28, U. parvum alone in 109, and both in 2. Among the PCR positive/culture-negative specimens, U. urealyticum was detected in 3 and U. parvum in 6.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
