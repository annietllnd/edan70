FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant construct (without tag) was cloned into MCS2 of pCDF Duet vector. Both plasmids were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Star and the genes were co-expressed. The proteins were purified using the same protocol as for the FLASH NTD proteins with the exception of using 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT as the size exclusion chromatography buffer. Relevant fractions corresponding to Lsm11 NTD-FLASH NTD C54S/C83A complex and excess Lsm11 NTD alone were pooled separately and concentrated to 5.3 mg/mL and 2.4 mg/mL respectively.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
