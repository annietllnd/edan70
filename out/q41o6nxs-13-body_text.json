The OH-SMART has been successfully used to analyse connections between and among public health, animal health and wildlife sectors, and facilitate improvements in the context of One Health operationalization (36) . The tool provides an approach for developing system-based maps detailing agency and stakeholder interactions specific to One Health challenges. The information and data promote stakeholder awareness to analyse processes and strengthen interactions. The OH-SMART process would be applied to increase the awareness of Arctic cross-disciplined partners and activities, to analyse current practices and to create a shared understanding of the current status of One Health approaches. The resulting assessment and baseline information would be used to illuminate the way forward for a One Health approach for the Arctic region, see Fig. 1 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
