A) Surface representation of the NS5 dimer in the asymmetric unit viewing down the pseudo 2-fold axis. Coloring scheme: molecule I MTase -lime, RdRP -green; molecule II MTase -cyan, RdRP -blue; linker -grey. B) Maximum likelihood superimposition of the two NS5 molecules in the asymmetric unit (RMSD = 0.5 Ã… ) shown as cartoon representation. Coloring scheme is as in panel A. C) NS5 has a retention volume around 68 mL in a superdex 200 gel filtration column, consistent with a monomeric state. Empirical retention volumes and molecular weights of three other globular proteins were indicated. PV and YFV are abbreviations of poliovirus and yellow fever virus, respectively. D) 10% SDS-PAGE analysis of the NS5 crystal. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
