The shedding of CPV and CDV is strongly associated with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea [4] . CPV-2 was typically seen in dogs without protective antibody titers, because of a lack of or an incomplete series of vaccinations [2] . A window of susceptibility also occurs in puppies, in which maternal antibody falls below protective levels but vaccine-induced immunity is lacking. CDV was involved in acute hemorrhagic diarrhea without prominent respiratory and neurological signs [28] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
