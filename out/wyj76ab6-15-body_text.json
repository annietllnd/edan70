Titre reduction is presented as the difference between the virus titre after contact with the test product and the control virus titre. This difference is given as a reduction factor including its 95 % confidence interval. A reduction in virus titre of ≥4 log 10 (corresponding to an inactivation of ≥99.99 %) was regarded as evidence of sufficient virucidal activity. The calculation was performed according to EN14476 [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
