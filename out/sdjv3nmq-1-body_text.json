So far, four subgroups of MAPKs are identified, namely extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK5, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) 2, 3 . Among them, ERK1/2 is activated by growth factors and mitogens, whereas p38 and JNK respond to cellular stresses and/or environmental stimuli 2 . MAPKs are activated by kinase cascades. In particular, JNK is activated by MAPK kinases 4(MKK4) or MKK7, which are phosphorylated by upstream MAPK kinase kinases 4 . JNK activation requires dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr motif 4 . Active JNK phosphorylates c-Jun and other substrates to modulate their activities 5 . For example, phosphorylated c-Jun dimerizes with other transcription factors to form activator protein-1(AP-1) complex, thereby activating transcription of target genes 6 . JNK pathway modulates apoptosis by two mechanisms: transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes and interactions with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family proteins 7 . JNKdependent activation of AP-1 upregulates expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bcl2 homologous antagonist killer, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha 8 . Some transcription factors, such as p53 and p73, are also activated by JNK and promote cell death 9, 10 . Also, JNK can translocate into mitochondria and modulate the function of Bcl2 family proteins, such as BH3-interacting domain death agonist 11 , Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death 12 , and Bcl2-associated death promoter 13, 14 . JNK can also directly phosphorylate Bcl2, inhibiting its anti-apoptotic activity 15 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
