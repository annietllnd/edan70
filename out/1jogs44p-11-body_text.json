We computed the unbiased estimate of the F ST for gene region SNPs in the HapMap II using the SPSmart server [40] . LD plots for CEACAM/PSG gene regions were generated using the HaploView 4.1 [41] . The LD blocks were determined using an r2 threshold of 0.8. Analysis of CNVs was performed using the International HapMap Project server (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en) and manual search of individual publications.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
