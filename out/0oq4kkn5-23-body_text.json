These results indicate the selectivity of the inhibitors for enteroviral proteases and confirm the selective recognition of the pyrazolone fragment in 14 and 20 by the S1-binding pocket of enteroviral proteases, which selectively bind substrates containing glutamine in P1. On the contrary, the tested serine/cysteine proteases with S1-preference for arginine, as trypsin and factor Xa, or for hydrophobic residues, as chymotrypsin, or for aspartate, as caspase-3, did not bind inhibitors 14 and 20.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
