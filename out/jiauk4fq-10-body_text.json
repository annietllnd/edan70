In order to determine the number of platelets, EDTA blood obtained from coccygeal vein and nasal swab samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 hours post-inoculation, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 14days post-inoculation (dpi) with BHV-1.1. The infected calves were sedated with xylazine (Rompun W 2% solution; Bayer Healthcare, Kiel, Germany) and euthanized by overdosing with thiopental-sodium (Thiovet W ; Vet Limited, Leyland, Lancashire, UK) in batches of two at 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 dpi. Two animals of the BVDV/BHV-1 group were killed at 0 dpi just before BHV-1.1 inoculation (BHV-1.1-UI), being used as BVDV infection controls for this group. On the contrary, the two negative control animals were euthanized at the end of the study, being used as UI controls for the BHV-1 group. The experimental procedure was carried out in accordance with the Code of Practice for Housing and Care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures, approved by the European Economic Community in 1986 (86/609/EEC amended by the directive 2003/65/EC).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
