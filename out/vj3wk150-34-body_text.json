The SARS-CoV infection also activates PKR. Unexpectedly, the activation of PKR is not involved in eIF2α phosphorylation and virus replication, but plays a role in viral induced apoptosis [47] . Overexpresson of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein resulted in activation of PERK and upregulation of GRP78/GRP94 [46] . Another ER localized transmembrane glycoprotein, 3a, also activates PERK and thus increases the level of phosphor-eIF2α, leading to activation of GRP78, GRP94, ATF4, and CHOP promoter, which is demonstrated by co-transfection of luciferase reporter plasmid with plasmid encoding 3a [23] . It is unclear whether spike protein or 3a protein plays a major role in SARS-CoV induced translation shutoff, as the translational rate is not examined upon overexpression of these proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
