Accordingly, mice were inoculated with JaTH160 virus at a challenge dose of 10 4 pfu per mouse, all WT, IL-10 KO and TNF-α KO mouse groups died. However, TNF-α KO mice presented with significantly shorter survival times than B6 WT mice (9.57±1.19 days and 12.8±0.89 days, respectively, Mann Whitney test: p=0.0002) ( Figure 7A ). It is important to note that viral loads in the brains were not significantly different for either WT, TNF-α KO or IL-10 KO mice at 5 and 7 days pi ( Figure  7B ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
