We next determined whether NS1 protein alone can induce protection against a ZIKV challenge. We first used DNA vaccination approach, as we know that DNA vaccine is safe to A129 mice. The NS1 gene with anchor C signal peptide was cloned into pCI vector. Both pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 expressed their intended proteins, E and NS1, in transfected 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 14) . A129 mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with pCI-prM-E or pCI-NS1, and boosted with the same plasmid two weeks later. Only 1 out of 5 mice in the pCI-prM-E group had E-specific ELISA and neutralizing Ab at week 1 (Fig. 5b, d) but all of them had high levels of ZIKV E-specific Ab at week 3 (Fig. 5c, e) . No ZIKV neutralizing Ab was detected in pCI-NS1 group even after the boost (Fig. 5d, e) , but Ab to NS1 was detected in 2 out of 5 mice at week 3 (Fig. 5g) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
