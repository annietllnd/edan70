The sensitivity results are summarized in S3 Table. It appeared that the latest estimate of the reproduction number was sensitive to the presence of effectiveness parameters (ε 1 and ε 2 ). Regardless of whether the assumed number of generations was 2, 3, or 4, AICc values of the model with both ε 1 and ε 2 were minimal (AICc = 1855.1, 1856.0, and 1855.2 for models with 2, 3, and 4 generations, respectively), Note: Two-generation, three-generation, and four-generation models indicated that there were a total two, three, and four generations, excluding generation zero. Mean μ IP and standard deviation σ IP of the incubation period were assumed as the parameters governing the gamma distribution. Mean μ Trans and standard deviation σ Trans of the duration of the generation times, other than incubation period, were also assumed to follow a gamma distribution. R n-1 is the reproduction number of the n thgeneration infection in the absence of interventions. To account for the effectiveness of interventions, ε i was factored into the model as the relative reduction in the reproduction number owing to mosquito control (ε 1 ) and park closure (ε 2 ). MSE represents the mean squared error. AICc is the Akaike information criterion with a correction for small sample size, calculated as AICc = AIC+ (2k(k+1))/(n-k-1), where n is the number of data points (i.e., n = 156) and AIC = 2NLL+2k where NLL is the negative log-likelihood and k is the number of parameters. The model average is the average of three former modes with weight as a function of AIC, which was calculated as 0.35, 0.25, and 0.40.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
