Dengue virus was used as a test subject to determine whether the EOPM method could detect the virus from an infected C6/36 cell culture (Tables 1, 2, and 3 ). As shown in Table 1 , among the 15 top ranked probes, eight targeted dengue virus specifically, while a further four probes targeted related flavivirueses such as Phnom Penh bat virus, Tembusu virus, and deer tick virus. We also carried out enrichment analysis of the positive probes at both the species and genus level. Notably, only dengue virus or closely related species showed significant enrichment (Table 2) , and only Flavivirus showed significant enrichment at the genus level (adjusted p-value<0.0001) ( Table 3 ). Both results were consistent with the known cultured dengue virus.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
