Skipping of exons 3, 4, 5, and 6 results in the anti-apoptotic caspase-9b isoform, whose protein product interferes with the formation of a functional Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex [39, 40] . Inclusion of these four exons, on the other hand, led to the synthesis of the antagonistic protein isoform of caspase-9, which is necessary for induction of apoptosis by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members [39] , calling for a precise regulation of these particular splice sites. The study elegantly refutes the dogma that the PI3K/Akt pathway only modulates alternative splicing through the regulation of SR proteins. Concerning apoptosis, Acinus-a component of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein complex (ASAP) which is present in functional spliceosomes [41, 42] -was also shown to be directly phosphorylated by Akt, at least during chromatin condensation, leading to the inhibition of its pro-apoptotic function [43] . This might be a clue to the general role of Akt in regulating the function of the splicing relevant ASAP complex, once again emphasizing the close relationship between splicing and apoptosis. These examples underline the significance of intermediated kinases, like PI3K and Akt, in transforming incoming signals via the regulation of alternative splicing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
