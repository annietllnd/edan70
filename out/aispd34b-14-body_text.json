Primers for detecting spliced var transcripts were designed to target the flanking regions of the intron (cross-intron primers). The 'amplification efficiency' of these cross-intron primers was not determined. However, all cross-intron primers were tested on genomic DNA in conventional PCR with increased elongation time and the PCR products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The crossintron products amplified from cDNA by Q-RT PCR were also fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
