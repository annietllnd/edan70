In particular, p38 is activated by MKK3, MKK4 [52] or MKK6 [53] , whereas JNK can be phosphorylated by MKK4 or MKK7 [54] . Dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in the conserved TxY motif (Thr-Gly-Tyr for p38 and Thr-Pro-Tyr for JNK) is essential for the complete activation of MAP kinases [49] . Upon activation, p38 translocates into the nucleus and activates multiple effector proteins, such as MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2), which in turn activates critical transcription factors such as cAMP Response Element-Binding protein (CREB) and Activating Transcription Factor 1 (ATF1) [55] . Moreover, p38 can also directly phosphorylate other important transcription factors such as p53 and CHOP [56, 57] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
