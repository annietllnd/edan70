The fragmentation conditions were as follows; run time 55 s, peak power 175.0 W, duty factor 5.0% and 200 cycles/burst. The Illumina library was constructed with KAPA Hyper Prep Kit Illumina platforms (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA). The quantity of the library was evaluated using the KAPA library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems). Each 300 bp of the paired-end sequences of each fragment were determined with the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, CA, USA).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
