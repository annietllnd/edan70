Rhinoviruses have a growth optimum of 33 o C, proliferating in the ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract where damage to these cells results in symptoms and predisposition to secondary bacterial infections. Interestingly, more differentiated airway epithelial cells, which have higher TLR3 expression, have increased resistance to rhinovirus infection [28] . Rhinovirus replication also induces -defensins-2 and -3 [85] and mucin production in primary human epithelial cells and cell lines, with induction being dependent on TLR3 and mucin production being negatively regulated by MyD88, and only partially dependent on TRIF [35] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
