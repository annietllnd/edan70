However within individual mice in each mouse group the range of viral infectivity varied from the lowest detection limit to 10 9 pfu/g of tissue at 9 and 11 days pi ( Figure  5B) . It therefore appears that the increased mortality in IL-10 KO and TNF-α KO mouse was not simply due to the increased viral loads in the brains, but other factors must also have contributed to the fatal disease in these KO mice.
