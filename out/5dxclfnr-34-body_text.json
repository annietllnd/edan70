This kinase is necessary for the regulation of cap-dependent translation carried out by the initiation complex eIF4F. After its inhibitory phosphorylation by activated Akt kinase [84] , the TSC is unable to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb, which finally leads to the maintenance of high levels of GTP. GTP then removes FKBP38 from mTORC1, thus restoring the latters' activity. Active mTOR in turn phosphorylates both the p70S6 kinase (S6K), which promotes translation elongation and ribosome biogenesis, and the eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP). Phosphorylated 4E-BP cannot prevent formation of the eIF4F complex-consisting of the cap-binding subunit eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A and the scaffolding protein eIF4G-thus translation can be initiated by the recruitment of the preinitiation-complex to the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap of the 5' end of the mRNA [85] (Figure 5 ). Hence viruses, depending on cellular 5'cap-dependent translation, must establish a strategy to either maintain mTOR activity or directly ensure eIF4F complex formation. It also phosphorylates S6K to facilitate ribosome biogenesis. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-mediated phosphorylation of the eIF4F subunit eIF4E is both mTOR-and PI3K-independent, whereas its phosphorylation of 4E-BP is dependent on PI3K. This is also the case for the vaccinia virus (VACV)-mediated 4E-BP phosphorylation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus on the other hand seem to regulate translation in a PI3K and mTOR-dependent manner.
