We used two strategies to eliminate the background of normal microflora. Firstly, at the experimental level, we always compared the suspected clinical sample with a normal sample of the same type, i.e. serum vs. serum or feces vs. feces. Secondly, on a database level, we compared clinical samples with the same type of samples from a database that included more than 30 different samples from a normal population, such as serum, feces, cerebrospinal fluid, and throat swabs. The second aspect may avoid unexpected issues in the experimental normal control. Under the above strategy, each clinical sample was first compared with a normal control, and then with the normal sample database, so that potential pathogens should be identified based on their increased distribution compared to the normal human samples.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
