Similar to most other countries, the peak influenza season in China is associated with higher health care utilization [2] . In China, weekly cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) in acutecare settings throughout the country are reported to the Chinese National Influenza Center(CNIC) and are mainly attributed to influenza virus, predominantly influenza A virus (FLU-A) and influenza B virus (FLU-B) [3, 4] . In addition to the influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses can also cause ILI symptoms in adults, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), including parainfluenza virus type 4 [5] , rhinovirus, adenovirus, human coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus [6] . Thus, multiple respiratory viruses may circulate among adults and cause influenza symptoms [5] . There is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections, and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection. Some studies have attempted to identify signs or symptoms specifically associated with influenza virus or other viruses [7, 8] , but no definitive conclusions have been drawn.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
