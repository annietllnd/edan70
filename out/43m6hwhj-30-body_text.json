Such observation is analogous to the results obtained by Wysocki and co-workers, who also observed the up-regulation of this pathway in lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs [62] . Tight junctions are specialized membrane domains, which maintain adjacent cells close enough to avoid uncontrolled passage of small molecules, microorganisms and cells, across the paracellular space [63, 64] . They are also involved in regulation of some cellular processes, including polarization, proliferation, differentiation and gene expression [65] [66] [67] . Our results suggest that also PRRSV may hijack tight junctions to use cellular machinery to support its own replication. It has been already reported that some viruses are able to regulate the expression or localization of tight junctions proteins to induce cell transformation or make their exit process more efficient. Reports evidenced the importance of tight junction for the infection of different viruses, including reoviruses, influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus 1 [68] [69] [70] [71] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
