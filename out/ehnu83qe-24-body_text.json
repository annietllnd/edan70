For example, the value of sample 948 was 156.2 ± 2.6, while the value of the anti-IgG was 189.6 ± 4.4, for a difference of 33.4 (P = 0.02). However, the value of the anti-IgM was 154.25 ± 0.25, and the difference was not obvious (P = 0.53). This indicated that IgG CMV antibodies were captured by the chip. For sample No. 940 detection, the value of the anti-IgG was 237.7 ± 11, and the increase was 77.3 (P = 0.01). The result also indicated that the content of IgG in samples No. 948 and 940 was different.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
