The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States evaluated the etiology of pneumonia in the community (EPIC study) between 2010 and 2012. The financial burden of pneumonia in the United States was estimated to be approximately $10 billion [6] . A pathogen was identified for 38% (853/2259) of adult patients who had radiologic evidence of CAP and an available specimen for diagnosis. For the 853 patients in whom a pathogen was identified, the etiologies included viral (62%), bacterial (29%), both viral and bacterial (7%), and fungal or mycobacterial (2%) pathogens with the most common being rhinovirus, influenza, and S. pneumoniae ( Figure 1 ) [6] . S. pneumoniae, with more than 90 capsular serotypes, remains the most commonly identified cause of community-acquired acute bacterial pneumonia [7] . In the European Union (EU), about 3,370,000 cases of CAP are expected annually with hospitalization rates ranging between 20% and 50% [8]. Other bacterial etiologies of pneumonia include Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae (usually nontypable) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although these are uncommon and often associated with a comorbidity, such as chronic obstructive lung disease or alcoholism. In a 3-year prospective study conducted in Finland, the etiology of CAP in children was detected in 86% of 254 children with 62% being viral, 53% bacterial, and 30% coinfection [9] . S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified causative pathogen [9] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
