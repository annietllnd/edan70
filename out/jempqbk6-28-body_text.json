The first group comprises protein chains of 50 known structures with an average TM-score of 0.61, encompassing proteins from positive-strand ssRNA, ssDNA, dsDNA and dsRNA viruses. All of them share the presence of the jelly-roll fold ( Figure 3A ). This structural motif has been previously reported to be found in a wide variety of viruses, including ssRNA, ssDNA, dsDNA and dsRNA viruses [8, 59] . There are no structural homologs of the jelly-roll capsids among the proteins from cellular organisms, and jelly-roll capsids also belong to the viral hallmark proteins [7] . Table 2 . Widely-populated and confined folds. For each dataset, clusters of similar viral structures with the respective PDB identification codes (three-character code and one-letter chain identifier) of the subunits considered are reported. For each cluster, a brief description of the biological function of the proteins is also given, as well as information about the type of genome of viruses falling in the same cluster.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
