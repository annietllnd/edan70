To rescue the NSP5/KO strain, a stop codon at residue 18Y was introduced ( Fig. 1A and B) . Analysis of MA104 virus-infected cell extracts confirmed the presence of NSP2 and VP2 but not of NSP5 ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, we did not detect viroplasms containing NSP2, VP2, or VP6 in either MA104-infected cells or stable transfectant cell lines expressing the fluorescent fusion protein NSP2-mCherry or NSP5-EGFP (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, this suggests that the NSP5-EGPF fusion protein is not able to trans-complement the lack of NSP5, and indeed the rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells (Fig. 2C) . Furthermore, both genomic dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 2D ) and infectious progeny virus production were completely abrogated in MA104 cells but not in the transcomplementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 2E ). Together, these data confirm that NSP5 is essential for RV replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
