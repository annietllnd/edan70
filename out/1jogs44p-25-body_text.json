These CNVs range from a few kb to as large as 0.8 Mb in a small fraction of individuals ( Fig. S4 in File S1). Consistently, recent data based on high-density probe comparative genome hybridization analysis and/or genome sequencing indicated that CNVs at the CEACAM/PSG locus are pervasive, and most of these CNVs are results of large segmental duplications (Fig. 5a) [51, 52, 53] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
