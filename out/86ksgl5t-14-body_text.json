RSAD2 or MX2 was then amplified using a pair of primers specific for porcine RSAD2 or MX2 (Table 1) , respectively. The PCR products were purified, digested, and cloned into pCAGGS-HA through EcoR I and Kpn I. Construction of the pRSAD2/pMX2-HA expression plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. Vero E6 cells were grown in 48-well plates to 70-80% confluence and then transfected with the pRSAD2/pMX2-HA expression plasmid using the Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), and the expression of pRSAD2/pMX2 was verified by anti-HA IFA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
