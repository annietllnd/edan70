In that case, cells expressing a cDNA library would be treated with a frameshift inducer, and the occurrence of differential phenotypes plus/minus frameshift inducer would be recorded. It is imperative that cDNA libraries with 3 -UTR regions are used in such an approach to facilitate the out-of-frame peptide expression after stop codon read-through.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
