The pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT, boiled for 5 min at 95uC and subjected to electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels. Viruses were purified and concentrated over a 20% sucrose cushion (in TN buffer) at 110,000 rcf. Pelleted virus was resuspended in TN buffer overnight on ice. After addition of Laemmli sample buffer (16 final concentration, 100 mM DTT), samples were boiled for 5 min at 95uC and subjected to electrophoresis in 7% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels. Upon transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), the presence of cellular and viral proteins was probed with antibodies against GM130 (rabbit pAb, Abcam), FLAG (HRPlabeled mouse anti-FLAG mAb, Sigma) or the S2 subunit of MHV A59 [105] (mouse anti-S2 mAb) diluted 1:1000. When necessary, the blots were subsequently incubated with HRP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit antibodies (both diluted 1:5000; DAKO). Binding of HRP-labeled antibodies was visualized using Amersham ECL Western blotting substrate (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
