Clinical samples usually contain host nucleic acid which may interfere with the sensitivity of microarray analysis. To determine the sensitivity of EPOM, we spiked viral RNA into human RNA, mimicking the actual clinical samples. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a single-stranded RNA virus, was cultured with Vero cells. The RNA from the culture supernatant medium was extracted and quantitatively determined using a qRT-PCR standard curve. Then, 10 3 -10 8 EV71 molecules were spiked into RNA extracted from 10 12 human HeLa cells. The RNA was then randomly amplified and hybridized with the EOPM microarray as described above. In parallel, RT-PCR using a pair of specific primers to amplify EV71 was performed to compare the sensitivity of the two methods.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
