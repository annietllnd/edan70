These attributes have fueled interest in exploring baculoviruses as vectors for recombinant protein expression systems and gene therapy [18] [19] [20] . In spite of the advantages of baculovirus, overcoming their lower efficacy relative to that of conventional vaccines remains a challenge [21] . We previously reported that a non-replicable baculovirus vector containing antigen-encoding DNA could serve as a nano-delivery system, and improve exogenous gene delivery into human cells by incorporating the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) on recombinant baculovirus [21] [22] [23] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
