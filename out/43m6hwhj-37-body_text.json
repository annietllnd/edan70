Interleukin 6 is a regulator of acute-phase response and also a lymphocyte stimulator factor, interleukin 8 plays a central role in inflammation process, while p38 MAPK pathway is known to be necessary for induction of different inflammatory cytokines in respiratory viral infections [86] and have been confirmed to be activated by PRRSV [87, 88] . The activation state of signaling pathways of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as induction of the p38 MAPK pathway, suggests potential mechanisms responsible for the highest virulence of BOR strain observed in the experimental infection study [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
