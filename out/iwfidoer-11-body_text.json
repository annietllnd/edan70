Adaptor and primer sequences were trimmed, and low quality sequence regions were removed with default parameters. PhiX sequences derived from control libraries and experimentally contaminated sequences (< 0.05% of total reads) were also removed using a mapping tool. The consensus sequences of viral contigs were obtained de novo exclusively with the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio), and assemblies were manually examined and extended using the Tablet viewer (27) . Using the mapping tool, each contig was confirmed to be constructed with at least 3 × sequence coverage, 10 × average coverage, and 1,000 bp in length. In cases of dominant reads (more than 10 reads) that stopped in the same position around the ends of contigs, the position was recognized as a terminal end. The predicted terminal ends of the viral genome segments were also confirmed by the presence of adjacent PCR primer sequences next to the predicted terminal sequence, except for cases of contigs with a poly(A) tail. Contigs with 70-90% nucleotide identity with other contigs were classified as the genome types of the same species. Contigs with > 90% nucleotide identity were assigned as the same genome type and only major contigs were used in further analyses. Sequences were compared against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide and amino acid (aa) databases using BLASTN-plus and BLASTX-plus, respectively (5), and then classified by MEGAN 5.7.1. (18) . A sequence analysis was performed using Genetyx-MAC software version 17.0.0 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and Genetyx software version 9.1.0 (Genetyx). Most full-length small subunit rRNA sequences in the diatom colony were reconstructed from RNA-seq reads with EMIRGE (26).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
