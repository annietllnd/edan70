Recently the structure of an RNA capable of catalyzing carbon-carbon bond formation by the Diels-Alder reaction was solved ( Figure 2B ) [18] . The RNA adopts a λ-shaped fold of its three helices in which stems 2 and 3 stack coaxially, with stem 1 abutting the active site, forming a pocket precisely complementary to the reaction product. The 5′ end of the RNA bridges helical stems 3 and 1, generating a complex nested pseudoknot topology. Although conformationally distinct from the HDV ribozyme [3] , it is worthwhile to note that they are two of the fastest-known ribozymes, and both utilize a nested pseudoknot architecture [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
