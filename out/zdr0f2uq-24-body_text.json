These viral envelope fragments can divert the humoral immune response by exposing immunodominant protein epitopes not presented on functional Env proteins, thereby eliciting undesirable non-neutralising antibodies during HIV-1 infection [129] [130] [131] . The role of nonneutralising epitopes in subverting the host immune response, away from neutralising epitopes, is an important consideration in vaccine development, and has stimulated the development of immunogens that closely mimic the native states of the HIV-1 viral spike [131, 132] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
