These methods include objective measurement of transmission such as the effective reproduction number, i.e., the actual average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case, sometimes in the presence of interventions [35, 36] . In the present study, we formulated a mathematical model and derived a likelihood function, aiming to estimate the effectiveness of interventions during the 2014 outbreak. Because several countermeasures were implemented on different dates during the outbreak, we calculated the effective reproduction numbers to assess the effectiveness of these interventions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
