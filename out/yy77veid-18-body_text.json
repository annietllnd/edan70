Our original description of the microscopy methods was somewhat difficult to follow. The 5 sections we mentioned in the original methods were used for cell counting and co-localization by immunocytochemistry. For each experimental protocol, we evaluated lung tissue sections from 3-5 animals. We revised the Methods section in the Supplemental Information section under the heading "Quantitative cell and tissue morphometry" to better describe how the morphometry was performed. The Source Data provide the details of the number of cells counted in tissue sections containing large and small airways from each animal.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
