Many large eukaryotic dsDNA viruses, including the NCLDV group, contain a kinase with this domain. Additionally, it can also be found in the Rous sarcoma virus (Alpharetrovirus) protein Src. The proteins closest to Src are the eukaryotic kinases Fyn and Fgr ( Figure 2B ). Although the GC content statistics do not support this hypothesis, it is plausible that Src was transferred into the Rous sarcoma virus from its host.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
