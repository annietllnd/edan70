This result suggested that our constructed baculovirus was capable of delivering VLP forming DNA to HEK 293T cell and VLP was formed directly inside the cell. Thus, AcHERV-VLP has additional advantage in production process; due to there is no extra purification of VLPs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
