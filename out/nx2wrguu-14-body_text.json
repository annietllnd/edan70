First, we decomposed the generation time of DENV infection into two parts, i.e., (i) the time from illness onset in an infected human to secondary transmission in another human via a mosquito, denoted as the random variable, t Trans , and (ii) the time from infection in a human to their illness onset, again denoted by the random variable, t lP , corresponding to the intrinsic incubation period. Let w t and f s be the probability mass functions (pmf) to which random variables t Trans and t lP follow, respectively, and we assumed that both functions would be derived from the cumulative distribution functions of gamma distribution, G(s), i.e., f s = G(s; μ lP , σ lP )−G(s−1; μ lP , σ lP ) for s>0. The parameters μ lP and σ lP are the mean and standard deviation of the (intrinsic) incubation period in humans. Similarly, we assume that the parameters μ Trans and σ Trans would determine the mean and standard deviation of the pmf w t . Then, the pmf of the generation time, g t , defined as the time from infection in a human to infection in its secondary human case via a mosquito, can be modeled by convolution,", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
