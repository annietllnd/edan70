RVF is characterized by a high rate of abortion and fetal malformation in pregnant ruminants, febrile illness in adult ruminants, and lethal acute hepatitis in newborn lambs [1] . In humans, patients suffer an acute febrile illness with occasional complications including partial or complete blindness, hemorrhagic fever, or neurological disorders [2, 3, 4, 5] . RVFV can be transmitted through the drought-resistant eggs of infected floodwater Aedes mosquitoes which thus play a role in maintaining RVFV in endemic areas. Other mosquito species are also involved in RVFV transmission if RVFV-infected mosquito population increases subsequent to heavy rain fall or increase in mosquito habitats [6, 7, 8, 9] . RVF has been endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and has spread into Madagascar, Comoro, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] . The development of an effective vaccine against RVF is important for non-endemic countries to prevent further spread of RVFV. RVFV is classified as an NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen and an overlap select agent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA) [18] . RVFV is transmitted via aerosol, and the handling of virus should be done in biosafety level (BSL) 3+ or 4 laboratories.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
