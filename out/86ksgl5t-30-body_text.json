Type I and III IFNs each signal through different heterodimeric complex receptors to initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways. In addition to activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, IFNs also activate the PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades (5, 32) . The combined use of these signaling pathways by IFNs and many other cytokines might help explain the different roles of IFNs in regulating the antiviral and immune responses in a variety of environments and locations. We have very limited knowledge on the pathways activated by IFN-λ, which are important for understanding the immune-modulating activities of IFN-λ (8) . In this study, we found that IFN-λ3 not only activates the classical antiviral response Jak-STAT signaling pathway but also primarily activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, the cAMP signal pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 4) . IFN-λ3 activated much more signaling pathways in epithelia than IFN-α, and this finding might provide new insights into the mechanism through which IFN-λ modulates other cellular functions beyond its direct antiviral activity. IFN-λ3 largely stimulated Wnt signaling pathway in IEC compared with IFN-α, which plays critical roles in maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal epithelia in vivo (33) . Further studies of different signaling pathways induced by IFN-λ3 or IFN-α will help dissect the complex interaction of IFN-induced signaling pathways with similar or overlapping intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by other cytokines.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
