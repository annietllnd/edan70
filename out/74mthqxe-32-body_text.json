Target To create cell lines stably expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3, we produced retroviral pseudotypes by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding IFITMs (pQCXIP-IFITMs), MLV-Gag-Pol (pCMV-gag-pol-MLV) and VSV-G (pMD.G) using the calcium phosphate method. Supernatants were harvested 48-72 h posttransfection and centrifuged at 3,200 g to remove cell debris. Cells were infected with pseudovirions in the presence of 5 mg/ml Polybrene. Twenty-four hour after infection, cells were selected in growth medium containing 1 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma). For production of MLV Gag-YFP pseudovirions bearing JSRV Env, 293/GP-LAPSN cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Gag-YFP and JSRV Env by the calcium phosphate method.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
