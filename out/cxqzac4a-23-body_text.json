In February of 2012, an outbreak of disease caused by an unknown pathogen occurred in Baoding City, Hebei Province. Patients presented with obvious infectious symptoms, such as high fever, coughing, throat congestion, lung tissue necrosis, and bronchopneumonia. Initially, influenza virus, SARS virus, and mycoplasma, known causes of these clinical symptoms, were suspected, but PCR tests were negative for all three pathogens. To rapidly identify the unknown pathogen, EOPM chips were selected to screen the possible pathogens responsible for these infections. Nucleic acid was extracted from patient serum samples to be used for EOPM analysis. Nucleic acid from normal serum was used as a control. One scanned microarray image is shown in Figure 1 , and the enrichment results for the top-ranked pathogens at species and genus level are listed in Tables 5 and 6 respectively. Adenoviruses were found to be significantly enriched, as were the top five species results (Tables 5 and 6 ). We further verified adenovirus as the causative agent by PCR targeted to a conserved region of Mastadenovirus genomic sequence (see Additional file 1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
