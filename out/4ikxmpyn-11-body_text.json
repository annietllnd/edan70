In primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, the DExD/H-box RNA helicase family member, DHX33, senses reoviral genomic RNA, interacts with NLRP3 to form the inflammasome complex, and leads to the secretion of IL-1β (34). 2 ′ ,5 ′ -oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS) recognizes dsRNA from some viruses, such as IAV and VSV, and promotes the cleavage thereof by endoribonuclease RNase L; the cleaved nucleic acids then be detected by DHX33 (35) . Furthermore, DDX19A, another DExD/H-box RNA helicase family member, senses porcine reproductive and respiration syndrome virus (PRRSV) and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation (36) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
