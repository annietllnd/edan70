To address this question, we took advantage of our previous finding that JSRV pseudovirions are virtually resistant to low pH inactivation and that an extracellular low pH pulse can overcome proton pump inhibitor-mediated block of JSRV entry [27, 33, 34] . We pretreated JSRV pseudovirion-bound HTX or HTX/IFITM1 cells with 20 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), followed by a pH-5.0 pulse for 5-10 min; cells were then allowed for infection for 4 h in the presence of BafA1. We observed that, while low pH substantially rescued the BafA1-mediated block in both the parental HTX and HTX/IFITM1 cells, as would be expected [33, 34] , the low pH treatment did not increase the JSRV titer in HTX/IFITM1 cells to a level that was similar to that of parental HTX cells (Fig. 4F ). This result apparently differed from that of SARS coronavirus, whose fusion inhibition by IFITMs had been previously shown to be bypassed by trypsin [13] . Overall, our data suggest that IFITM1 expressed on the plasma membrane effectively blocks the forced entry of JSRV rendered by the low pH pulse, and this is consistent with the cell-cell fusion data.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
