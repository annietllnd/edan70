A high burden of dental caries was evident among children in Saudi Arabia with an estimated prevalence of approximately 80% [2] ; other high-risk areas include Latin America, Middle East, and South Asia [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the need to reduce global burden of dental caries in attaining optimal health. Consequently, in the year 2003, WHO and Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) World Dental Federation set global goals for oral health in 2020 to guide planners and policy makers to improve the status of oral health in their populations [4] . Unfortunately, knowledge gaps with respect to the availability of baseline data on oral health and population-specific key modifiable factors of dental caries restrict the ability of many developing nations and semi-developed countries, including Saudi Arabia to attain the goals set by WHO. In addition, competing interests in health care funding warrant prioritizing the associated factors to better direct public health mitigation efforts.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
