The difficulties reported in measuring and analyzing the structure of SARS may reflect a composite structure of this region in which both structures exist (possibly in equilibrium). We expect the reported structure to be the most stable. However, the clear imino-proton signal is consistent with either structure and much of the cleavage data appears to fit either structure. Perhaps developing a more detailed approach to analyzing the local structure and fine tuning of the parameterizations will favor the reported structure. An alternative structure is also shown for the case where a Kuhn length of 4 or 6 is used (Fig. 2a) . This latter structure resembles the tandem pseudoknots of TMV. Almost all the viral frame shift sequences we studied appear to have a fairly large diversity of structural morphologies. Some of these alternative structures may actually represent alternative states of the structure that are used to decide the frame shift mode. With the development of suboptimal structure prediction, a model as versatile as vsfold5 can study these energy differences more closely.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
