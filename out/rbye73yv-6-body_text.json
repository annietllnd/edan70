Binding between RBD and the cell receptor triggers a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate of S2, in which the hydrophobic HR1 is exposed and allows the fusion peptide to insert into the target cell membrane. This transient S2 intermediate then refolds with HR2 into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called six-helix bundle structure (6-HB), which brings the target cell membrane into close proximity of the viral envelope, resulting in the completion of the fusion process and initiation of the virus life cycle [21] (Figure 1(B) ). Structure-based design of various peptides able to block the formation of 6-HB have demonstrated potent inhibition on MERS-CoV replication and spike-mediated cell-cell fusion, showing great promise for further development into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating MERS-CoV infection [26, [28] [29] [30] . Among them, the peptide EK1 is effective to multiple human coronaviruses apart from MERS-CoV and therefore serves as a potential pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor [30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
