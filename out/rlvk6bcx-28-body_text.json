The very high genetic diversity of the MHC is believed to have been shaped by exposure to different pathogen species [18] . Also, following the recent development of techniques to sequence ancient DNA, it has been suggested that immunity genes such as those encoding toll-like receptors have been acquired following hybridization with archaic humans and are over-represented in the current gene pool of anatomically modern humans relative to genes not involved in immunity [19, 20] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
