As mortality rate increased, the cost of infrastructure and higher cost management systems showed a larger increase in the dollar amount added for each calf. Across management styles, decreasing the mortality rate from 15% to 2% reduced overall cost from $39.47 to $36.84 per calf. For a farm raising 500 pre-weaned calves annually, potential savings by decreasing mortality 10% alone could be over $18,000. It has been found that management practices specific to a housing type can change illness prevalence. For example, calves housed in groups of 12-18 had a higher incidence of respiratory illness and lower daily gains than calves housed in groups of 6-9 [9] . We assume a constant square footage per calf, therefore the barn square footage increases as the number of calves increase and this may not always be reflective of true management practices. A limitation to the model is the same probabilities in averages and ranges in mortality for all management pathways for calculated cost.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
