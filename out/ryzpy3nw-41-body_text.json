This is considered to be extremely unlikely as these observations were only made in a minority of the cats and similar results were observed in group T08 (two vaccinates which had until day 1136 either remained seronegative or had been seropositive on just one occasion post vaccination). Furthermore, all cats in groups T07 and T08 remained healthy throughout the pre-challenge period and were confirmed to be negative for p27 antigen when tested at various intervals prior to challenge. The cats were obtained from a Specified Pathogen Free (SPF) facility and were housed in a bio-security category 2 facility throughout the duration of the study; it would therefore be extremely unlikely that extraneous FeLV virus could have gained access into the facility.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
