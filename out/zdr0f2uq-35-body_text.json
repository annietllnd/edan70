On one hand, these glycans can trigger a sterilising innate immune response, for example by the activation of the complement cascade. On the other hand, viruses can exploit innate immune receptors such as dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] to facilitate and/or augment infection. DC-SIGN possesses a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that co-ordinates a calcium ion in the primary subsite to facilitate the binding of oligomannose-type glycans found on viruses (Fig. 4C) . DC-SIGN binds to the Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manα tri-mannose structure found on oligomannose type glycans [216, 217] . Importantly, not all glycoforms can be bound by DC-SIGN. Specificity to oligomannose-type glycans is conferred by the presence of a phenylalanine side chain in the CRD that acts as a steric block obstructing the GlcNAc residues of the N-linked glycan core, when a core mannose residue of a complex-type glycan attempts to bind [217] . This selectivity to oligomannose-type glycans ensures that DC-SIGN interactions are predominantly with foreign pathogens, due to the rarity of oligomannose-type glycans expressed on correctly processed host glycoproteins [67, 68] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
