The replication of HCV is accompanied by the formation of lipid rafts, followed by an increased production of the proto-oncogene N-Ras, a known activator of the PI3K-signaling pathway [77] . This consequently results in Akt activity leading to protection against apoptosis. Interestingly, upon inhibition of either signaling molecules, the levels of HCV replication is raised. As this virus establishes chronic infection in most of the cases, Mannova and Beretta claimed that the activation of the Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may ensure both cellular survival and the maintenance of persistent infection by maintaining the virus production at a low level [76] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
