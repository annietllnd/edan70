We compared them to 142 "unsuccessful" Pfam proteins that gave no hits (all E p values > 10 −2 ). We repeated the analysis for the F = 0 and F = 1 frames. The F = −2 and F = 1 "successful" sets shared 43 proteins out of 50, so we only present the F = −2 and F = 0 sets. Tables 3 and 4 and Fig. 7 summarize the results. The "successful" proteins are slightly longer on average and the corresponding Pfam families are slightly less diverse, especially for the viral set (F = −2 scheme), with a mean entropy of 1.4, vs. 2.5 for the unsuccessful set ( Table 3 ). The mean codon degeneracy and Differences in codon usage are more striking, especially when comparing the most successful viral proteins (F = −2 scheme) to the least successful Pfam proteins (Fig. 7) . In contrast, in the F = 0 scheme (which gave fewer successful designs), the successful/unsuccessful differences are much smaller, with only six codon frequencies shifted by just over 0.005.
