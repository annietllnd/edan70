However, the magnitude of risk among Australian children sleeping with a bottle in mouth was much lower (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2) [39] . It was suggested that decreased salivary flow and reduced swallowing reflex as the child gets drowsier would allow carbohydrates to remain in the mouth and pool around the teeth priming the area for bacterial attack [40, 41] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
