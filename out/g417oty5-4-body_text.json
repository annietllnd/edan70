In order to better understand the association of the genetic characteristics of HAdV-7 and clinical manifestations and outcomes between children with severe ARD and mild respiratory disease, seven representative HAdV-7 isolates, including one from an outpatient (OP) causing mild respiratory disease (OP01_2011), three from inpatients (IP; fatal outcome) named IP01_2010, IP02_2011 and IP03_2011, two from severe cases (IP04_2011 and IP05_2012) (required intensive care and mechanical ventilation), and one from an IP with comparatively mild ARD (IP06_2012) (diagnosed as bronchitis; discharged after 4-day hospitalization), were selected to perform next-generation whole-genome sequencing on Ion Torrent PGM TM using 318 v2 chips; it yielded 6,063,042 reads with an average length of 182 bp, which was obtained with a mean coverage of 2,409x. The assembly in each samples yielded 3 or 4 contigs after PASA analysis. All of these samples have one long contig covering above half of the reference genome (N50 > 17 kb). The local coverage rates varied between 91-92%. The numbers of gaps identified in each samples were 3-5. These gaps were covered by Sanger sequencing for more than three times (84 in total) following PCR amplification. The complete genome sequences of strains OP01_2011, IP01_2010, IP02_2011, IP03_2011, IP04_2011, IP05_2012 and IP06_2012 were deposited in the GenBank database under accession nos.
