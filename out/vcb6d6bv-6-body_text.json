On the other hand, for class II viroporins the algorithm detects, not one but two TM segments with a surprisingly positive ∆Gapp value (+0.5 kcal/mol in average). Furthermore, in some cases (eg. 2B from PV1) only one TM helix is predicted; the other hydrophobic region is not recognize as a TM by the algorithm, probably due to its low hydrophobicity, even though its presence has been experimentally confirmed [16] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
