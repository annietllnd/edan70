Virus evolution has been linked to selfish genetic elements [15, 16] . By means of the comparison of protein structures and genome organization, a subset of DNA viruses has been shown to be related to polintons, a class of eukaryotic transposons and mitochondrial plasmids [16] . However, this approach does not provide a unified picture of viral evolution due to the lack of structural data and of our ability to compare structures sharing little similarity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
