Indeed, to evaluate their role in evolution, we should have a precise idea of the difficulty to create them. The rarity of contemporary examples and the stringent overlap constraints suggest that it is very difficult. To quantify in a general way the difficulty to create overlapping genes, we have examined the possibility of encoding an arbitrary pair of protein domains in a single DNA segment, as a fully-overlapping dual gene. We considered three possible reading frames for the second protein, relative to the first: two on the antisense strand and one on the sense strand. Indeed, sense and antisense overlap schemes have different implications for the biological hypotheses above and different capabilities to code a variety of amino acid types 11, 17 . One sense:antisense overlap scheme placed the third, wobble base in each codon opposite the central nucleotide of another codon (Fig. 1) . Given the structure of the genetic code, this is expected to be the most favorable scheme, as confirmed below. Another scheme placed the central bases of the sense and antisense codons opposite each other (F = 0 scheme, Fig. 1 ). This is less favorable, since each central base constrains the other. The two sense:sense overlap schemes are similar and we chose one of them.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
