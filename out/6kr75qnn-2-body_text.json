Among emerging infectious diseases, approximately 2/3 are of zoonotic origin [1] . While bats fulfill many ecologically important functions, several species were recognized as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. Emerging human diseases caused by bat-borne viruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Hendra and Nipah encephalitides, as well as Ebola-and Marburg hemorrhagic fever [2] [3] [4] . A recent outbreak of severe respiratory infection in the Middle East region caused by the novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV with close identity to bat coronaviruses emphasizes the relevance of batborne zoonotic diseases [5] [6] [7] . The conditions and mechanisms behind animal-to-human spillover are unknown.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
