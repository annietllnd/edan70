The earliest mAbs reported in 2014 were identified through screening non-immune human scFv libraries with the ectodomain of S glycoprotein (mAb 3B11) [40] or soluble RBD from S glycoprotein (MERS-4, MERS-27 and the m336 panel) [37, 42] as bait protein (Figure 3(A) ). These antibodies all demonstrated high neutralizing activities and therefore were widely used as reference antibodies in later studies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
