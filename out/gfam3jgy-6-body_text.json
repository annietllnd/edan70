The incidence and clinical presentation of this infection varies widely, and often involves co-infection with other potential pathogens [9] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most prevalent pathogen associated with HBoV in all the studies [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Such characteristics have led to debate over the role of HBoV as a true pathogen. Therefore, additional evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to gain a better understanding of this virus. We investigated whether HBoV1 at a high viral load increases the severity of RTI and whether co-detection with HBoV1 and another respiratory virus or viruses increases the severity of concurrent viral detection. We study the prevalence of HBoV1 and the genome of the HBoV1 load in respiratory tract specimens from children hospitalized for RTI to investigate the association between HBoV1 detection and SRTI. This article might increase our understanding of the role of HBoV1 in SRTI.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
