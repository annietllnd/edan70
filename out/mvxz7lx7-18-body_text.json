In addition, a scheme to recruit overseas-trained medical practitioners was included in the Australian Government's Medicare Plus policy initiatives [9] . It is intended that these doctors will work in rural and remote areas officially designated as having medical workforce shortages and also in positions within Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Services. Yet, metropolitan hospitals are have also become reliant upon overseas-trained doctors for their staffing. This policy, accompanied by the liberalization of immigration arrangements for medical doctors, has represented a volte face from previous policies deliberately designed to discourage foreign doctors from immigrating in the belief that controlling the number of doctors would contribute to cost-containments of Medicare. It also continues to raise the ethical danger of Australia contributing to a "brain drain" of medical staff from countries that are themselves short of such expertise. In 2002 the Commonwealth of Nations had agreed to a code of practice for the international recruitment of health workers to help safeguard the interests of developing nations. Australia has endorsed the code.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
