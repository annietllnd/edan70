As a co-chaperone and cell survival protein, BAG3 regulates multiple cell pathways, including, apoptosis, autophagy, cell development and cytoskeleton organization [45, 55, 56] . Indeed, BAG3 is induced under conditions of cell stress and plays a major role in sequestering misfolded and/ or foreign proteins to the proteasome for degradation by CMA [45, 55, 56] . Our data imply that the CMA function of BAG3 acts as a novel host defense/response mechanism to sequester a fraction of VP40 from the site of budding at the PM and into aggresomes, thus reducing VLP/ virus egress and spread. Whether sequestration of VP40 away from the PM results in degradation of VP40 remains to be determined. Interestingly, selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy) was recently shown to regulate EBOV replication in murine cells [57] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
