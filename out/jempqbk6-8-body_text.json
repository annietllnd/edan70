The major goal of the study was to detect the unlikely event of horizontal gene transfer between seemingly unrelated viruses. Through comparison of protein sequences, we have identified proteins from several protein families that appear in very distant viruses, with a conserved function, but with an origin that cannot be traced back to a single viral class, possibly pointing to several HGT events from the host. The sequence similarity in viral proteins quickly becomes undetectable with the increase of evolutionary distance. Here, we report an all-to-all comparison of the three-dimensional structures of viral proteins from different function classes that reveals many more relationships between proteins of viruses in different Baltimore classes, both structural and enzymatic. Overall, we detect two patterns in the evolution of viral proteins. Some protein families are populated by many viral proteins originating from species in different Baltimore classes and probably date back to ancient evolutionary events that led to a wide spread of certain folds in viruses. In other cases, only a small set of viruses harbor proteins similar to those from an unrelated family, in which case horizontal gene transfer events can be usually pinpointed, both between viruses and from host to virus.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
