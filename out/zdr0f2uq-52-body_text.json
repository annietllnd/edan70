The recent advances in the field of glycosylation analysis have provided greater insights into the roles that glycans play in protein trafficking and folding, viral attachment, and immune responses to infection. Often these viral glycoproteins are sole antigens expressed on the viral surface, and as such constitute crucial vaccine targets. Since antigenic mimicry is fundamental to most licensed vaccines [169] ; it is important that the glycosylation of immunogens is representative of that observed on the virus, as the elicitation of antibodies against epitopes that are occluded on the virus, and against non-native glycoforms is undesirable. Moreover, glycosylation of immunogens can play central roles in innate immune recognition to enhance humoral immunity [310] . The understanding of glycan structures, modes of recognition, and their functionality have also resulted in the development of several therapeutics to combat a wide array of deadly pathogens [93, 105, [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] . We suggest that a growing understanding of viral glycobiology will provide further opportunities to rationally develop novel therapeutics and vaccines.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
