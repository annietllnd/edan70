The coincident down-regulation of mTOR Signalling in DAN group and PI3K Signaling in B Lymphocytes in ILI and BOR groups indicate the clear influence on inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. This picture, clearly observed in ILI and DAN groups, is known to be one of the hallmarks of interferon signaling [72] . A similar picture was observed by Wilkinson and co-workers in pigs infected with PRRSV Type 2 strain [73] . Additionally, Cell Cycle: G1/S Checkpoint Regulation pathway controlling the passage of the cells from the G1 into the DNA synthesis (S) phase, was associated with downregulated genes in BOR group. Zhou et al. showed already that the genes relevant to cell cycle and DNA replication can be regulated by highly pathogenic PRRSV [74] . Similarly, Sun and co-workers noticed in microarray experiment that PRRSV nsp11 is able to regulate cell cycle and DNA replication and by in vitro experiment proved that nsp11 induced the delay of cell cycle progression at the S phase. Such cell cycle arrest may be beneficial for the virus, since it can redirect cellular replicative machinery for viral replication, as can be observed for other DNA and RNA viruses [75] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
