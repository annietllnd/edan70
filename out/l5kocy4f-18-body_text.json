For this, HEK293T cells were transfected with vector (pCAGGS) alone, VP40 + vector, VP40 + BAG3-WT, or VP40 + WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-ΔN, and both cytosol and PM fractions were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig 9) . NA/K ATPase was used as a positive expression control for the PM fraction, and β-actin was used as a cytosol control (Fig 9A and 9C ). As expected, both eVP40 and mVP40 were detected at equivalent levels in all cytosol fractions (Fig 9A and 9C, lanes 2-4) ; however, the levels of eVP40 and mVP40 in PM fractions from cells expressing BAG3-WT were consistently reduced by 2-3 fold (Fig 9A and 9C, lane 7; and Fig 9B and 9D ) compared to that detected in the PM fractions of cells expressing VP40 alone (lanes 6) or VP40 + BAG3-ΔN (lanes 8).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
