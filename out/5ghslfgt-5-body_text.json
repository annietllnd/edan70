These approaches are especially useful when the epidemiological data are limited [6] [7] [8] [9] . Real-time short-term forecasts generated from such models can be useful to guide the allocation of resources that are critical to bring the epidemic under control. In this paper, we use dynamic models to generate 5-day and 10-day ahead forecasts of the cumulative reported cases in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, China.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
