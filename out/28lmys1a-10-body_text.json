Barn cost was derived from the Dairy Calf and Heifer Association Gold Standard recommendation of 3.3 M 2 per calf, with an additional 15% of space to account for walkways and feed areas. Thus, replacement heifers were assumed to require 3.7 M 2 per calf. Construction cost [11] varied based on the infrastructure required for each situation, ranging from $10.00 to $15.50 per M 2 . Estimated barn value (BV) was then calculated with Equation (1). BV = CC × 3.7 M 2 × number of pre-weaned calves (1) Barn cost per heifer (BC) was calculated using the payment function in excel with 7% interest, 20 years useful life and BV. BC was included in IHI and GH situations. Calves housed in individual housing outside followed the same payment function. Housing calves year-round in individual housing with an average occupancy time of 2 months ± rest period would allow 5 calves per hutch per year. Days of age at weaning was used as the length of time a heifer was incurring cost during the pre-weaning period. Housing costs also included utility costs, such as water and electricity. Electricity was only factored for housing systems that included a barn (IHI and GH). The bedding ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
