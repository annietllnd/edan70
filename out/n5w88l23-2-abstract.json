Even if these enzymes have similar functions, they have relatively low amino acid sequence identity. These metal-dependent enzymes catalyze the ring-opening hydrolysis of the cyclic amide bond of each substrate in either five-or six-membered rings in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, and many xenobiotics ( Fig 1A) [9, 11, 12, 13] . Almost all the active sites of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase contain four histidines, one aspartate, and one post-carboxylated lysine residue, which are required for metal binding and catalytic activity. The presence of a post-carboxylated lysine in hydantoinase is also required in binuclear metal center self-assembly [12] , and it increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide for catalysis [14] . Previous studies indicated that cyclic amidohydrolases should use a nearly identical mechanism for catalysis. However, the substrate selectivity and specificity of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase highly differ. For example, dihydroorotase does not hydrolyze dihydropyrimidine, hydantoin, and allantoin [15] . Fig 1. Substrate specificity of dihydropyrimidinase.
