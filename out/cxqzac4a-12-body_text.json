The carrier RNA from the kit was applied to extract virus nucleic acid with low molecular weight. The kit can be used to extract the nucleic acid from both RNA and DNA viruses (like adenovirus), as well as bacteria, fungi, and parasites. A previously described random PCR amplification strategy [7] with minor modification was applied to amplify extracted nucleic acids and label amplified products with fluorescent dye. In brief, the first cDNA strand was reverse transcribed with a random decamer heeled with a PCR primer (5′-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATCNNNNNNNNN-3′). The first strand cDNA was then synthesized to double-stranded DNA using the same primer and Klenow DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China). Double stranded cDNA from both patients and normal controls was PCR amplified using the heel primer. Resultant PCR amplicons were then purified and labeled with Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP for the normal controls and patient samples, respectively, using Klenow polymerase (Takara). Labeled DNA was mixed with 60 μl of hybridization buffer and added to the 8 × 60,000 EOPM arrays for hybridization overnight at 65°C in a hybridization oven (Agilent). The EOPM arrays were then washed with 2× SSC, 0.005% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 min, followed by a second wash with 0.2× SSC at 37°C for 1 min. The arrays were then scanned using a dual-laser scanner (Agilent) and the images were extracted and analyzed using Feature Extraction software (Agilent).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
