The most striking differences were in codon usage, with 20 codons out of 61 significantly enriched or depleted within the most successful viral proteins, compared to the least successful proteins (with the F = −2 overlap scheme; Fig. 7 ). This may be the result of ancestral selective pressure for gene overlap, even though the modern viral proteins in our dataset do not overlap with each other. Similar trends were found in our larger set of successful proteins, with both the F = −2 and F = 1 overlap schemes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
