For each image series, SUVs for each voxel were calculated using an external filter in PMOD, with the radionuclide half-life set at 6586.2 sec for 18F-FDG. For each pulmonary lesion, an ellipsoid volume of interest (VOI) was generated that encompassed the structure. Then, automatic isocontour detection was used to refit the VOI by setting a threshold of 50-60% of the difference between the maximum and minimum intensity SUVs in the ellipsoid VOI such that 0.5*(SUV max 2SUV min ). In cases where the automated threshold included contiguous structures in the VOI, manual refitting in conjunction with the co-registered CT scan was used to exclude those surrounding structures. For all VOIs, maximum SUV (SUV Max ) and average and standard deviation of all pixels in the volume (SUV Mean 6 SD) were calculated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
