At 24 hours post transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After washing 3X with cold PBS, cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-eVP40 antiserum and mouse anti-cmyc antiserum to detect his-myc tagged BAG3 and its mutants. Next, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (LIFE TECHONOLO-GIES). Cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue fixed cell ready probes (LIFE TECHONOLO-GIES). Microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope and an XZY scanning model. Serial optical planes of focus were taken on the Y-axis and the collected images were merged into one by using the Leica microsystems (LAS AF) software.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
