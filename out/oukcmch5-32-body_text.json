Endocytic uptake is also required for a mutant virus carrying a S protein with a FCS immediately upstream of its FP, despite the relative insensitivity to high concentrations of BafA1. Therefore, the ability of a virus to infect cells in the presence of BafA1 does not necessarily imply virus entry to occur at the cell surface. Also a recombinant MHV carrying the spike protein of MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) was found to enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (MHV-S4; Figure S10 in Text S1) despite its ability to cause extensive cell-cell fusion [80] [81] [82] . The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. Similarly, RSV was recently shown to enter cells after endocytic uptake despite the ability of this virus to cause cell-cell fusion [13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
