We showed that the NSP5/S67A mutant from the rRV was indeed hyperphosphorylated, albeit not completely, when infecting MA-Δ3 cells, restoring the round morphology of the structures resembling viroplasms with a complete absence of the aberrant structures observed in MA104 cells. This finding strongly suggests that impairment of NSP5 phosphorylation is the direct cause of the formation of the aberrant structures in the cytosol of the infected cell. Despite the fact that these structures appeared morphologically similar to the classical round viroplasms in MA-Δ3 cells, the presence of VP6 around these structures was observed only with the hyperphosphorylated NSP5/S67A mutant, not with the other NSP5 phosphorylation-negative mutants. One possibility is that during RV infection, accumulation of VP6 in round-shaped viroplasms requires a full-length hyperphosphorylated NSP5, as well as phosphorylation of multiple serine residues, likely by CK2 (17, 26) . Moreover, the round structures found in MA-Δ3 cells infected with rRV-NSP5/KO failed to contain VP6.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
