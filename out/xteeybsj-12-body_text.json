Despite viral circulation, we found that one and 26 farms were seronegative for H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses, respectively. At these farms, as well as at farms with low antibody levels, the pigs were still susceptible to influenza virus infection and clinical disease because of their lack of immunity against the virus. The introduction of influenza virus into a herd is usually associated with moving and the introduction of new animals. 22 Moreover, a higher seroprevalence of anti-influenza antibodies has been associated with a greater density of pigs, which may lead to increased contact and also facilitate airborne transmission between herds. 23 Minas Gerais is the fourth largest pork producing state in Brazil, and 22Á6% of its commercial farms have ≥100 sows, 24 which suggests that a high pig density in the state may be associated with risk factors for influenza virus infection, particularly in negative herds, in which pigs are more vulnerable.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
