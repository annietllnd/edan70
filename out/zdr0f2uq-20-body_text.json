Current influenza vaccines poorly display NA epitopes and do not produce robust anti-NA antibodies [106] , whilst during infection many NA-reactive B cells and antibodies are produced. The development of recombinant influenza vaccines, which improve the display of influenza NA, may provide a method of vaccine optimisation to improve targeting of NA for broader protection against divergent influenza strains circulating in human populations [106] [107] [108] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
