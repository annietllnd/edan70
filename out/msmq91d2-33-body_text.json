Inclusion of negative DIVA marker helps to detect animals exposed to wt RVFV during outbreak. Unfortunately, MP-12 vaccine does not have a DIVA marker, and further improvement of MP-12 is required for an efficient detection of naturally infected animals during RVF outbreak. We determined whether mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs can induce IgG reactive to RVFV NSs or not. For the purpose, we used IgG ELISA using Cterminus RVFV NSs [45] . We used the C-terminus NSs because the antigen is soluble, and detect anti-NSs antibody at higher sensitivity than IgG ELISA using purified whole RVFV NSs (Fig.  S4) . As shown in Fig. 7D , none of the mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced detectable levels of IgG cross-reactive to the C-terminus of RVFV NSs, while 26% of mice vaccinated with MP-12 had detectable anti-NSs IgG in our IgG ELISA. The presence of anti-RVFV NSs antibody in vaccinated animals will compromise the DIVA strategy to detect animals exposed to wt RVFV. On the other hand, the rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce anti-RVFV NSs antibody detectable in this IgG ELISA, and are applicable to DIVA. We also noted that all mice vaccinated with MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs raised anti-NSs IgG after wt RVFV challenge, suggesting the vaccinations do not confer sterile immunity, and wt RVFV replicated in vaccinated mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
