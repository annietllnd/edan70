These glycans have been shown to play an advantageous role for the virus in infecting human dendritic cells, via DC-SIGN mediated recognition [209] . Lassa infection of macrophages and dendritic cells is thought to be crucial to viral pathogenesis, as the virus can be propagated in these cells while also not inducing their activation, suggesting a mechanism of avoiding immune surveillance [236] . Thus, whilst DC-SIGN may not be the primary receptor for Lassa virus, the oligomannose-type glycans on the GPC do act as attachment factors and positively influence infection of immune cells. A similar phenomenon has been observed for HIV-1 Env, where recognition of oligomannose-type glycans by DC-SIGN has been shown to augment infection of T cells [237] . This DC-SIGN-mediated enhancement of infection of target cells via trans-infection has also been observed across other viruses, including SARS [238] . A wide range of other membraneassociated lectins besides DC-SIGN and mannose receptor such as, hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, liver/lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin, siglecs, and macrophage Gal/GalNAc-specific C-type lectin have been implicated to have pro-viral effects [221] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
