To test this, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with BAG3 plus WT or PPxY mutants of eVP40 (eVP40-ΔPT/PY) and mVP40 (mVP40-P>A) (Fig 3A and 3B ). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with non-specific IgG, anti-eVP40 antiserum, or anti-mVP40 antiserum as indicated (Fig 3A and 3B) , and His-cmyc-tagged BAG3 was detected in precipitated samples by Western blot using either anti-cmyc or anti-His antisera (Fig 3A and 3B ). Exogenously expressed BAG3 was detected in eVP40-WT precipitates ( Fig 3A, lane 3) , but was not detected in preimmune IgG, nor eVP40-ΔPT/PY precipitates ( Fig 3A, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) . Similarly, exogenously expressed BAG3 was detected in mVP40-WT precipitates (Fig 3B, lane 3) , but was not detected in preimmune IgG, nor mVP40-P>A precipitates (Fig 3B, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) . These results indicated that both eVP40 and mVP40 interact with full length BAG3 in a PPxY-dependent manner in transiently transfected HEK293T cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
