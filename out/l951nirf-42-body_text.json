In conclusion, our findings indicate that the VLP-forming AcHERV-VLP vaccine could be considered a new candidate DNA vaccine for use against new emerging influenza virus epidemics Supporting Information S1 Fig. Experimental timelines. BALB/c mice were divided into four immunization groups (n = 12 mice/group): (1) PBS control (100 μl), (2) killed vaccine (2.0 μg killed vaccine), (3) AcHERV-HA (1×10 7 FFU/50 μl) and (4) AcHERV-VLP (1×10 7 FFU/50 μl) and given i.m. injection ("). On days 0, 7, or 21 blood collection, splenectomy and pneumonectomy were performed, respectively (#). Two weeks after immunization, mice were transferred to a biological safety level 2 facility, where they were sedated and challenged intranasally with mouse-adapted influenza virus A/CA/04/2009 (ma-pH1N1) at a 20LD 50 dose (▲). Mice were observed health condition and weighed for 14 consecutive days. (TIFF) S1 File. NC3Rs ARRIVE Guidelines checklist. (PDF) S1 Table. Primers used in this study.
