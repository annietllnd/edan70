This catalytic mechanism is applicable to each member in the cyclic amidohydrolase family [41, 48, 49] . However, a question remains as to why a common mechanism-based inhibitor for these imide-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as imidase, hydantoinase, dihydropyrimidinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, is difficult to find. New and undetermined factors should be further studied and discovered in this protein family, such as the third metal ion recently found in dihydroorotase, which was found to be highly important for catalysis [50, 51] . Further studies are also necessary to investigate the substrate specificity, selectivity, and catalytic mechanism of dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase, as well as other cyclic amidohydrolases. 2 analysis showed that 99.58% of the secondary structure is aligned, indicating a highly similar structure between human and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase.
