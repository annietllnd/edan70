The structure reveals that the MTase attaches to the backside of the RdRP through interactions that are conserved and unique for the whole flavivirus genus. Implications and hypothesis regarding possible other functional conformations were discussed considering available structural and functional studies. The structure sets up the stages to explore functional polymerase-RNA complexes in different stages of RNA synthesis and to study the interactions between NS5 and viral/host factors, while the observation of the interface between the RdRP and MTase generates opportunities for antiviral development for JEV and other important human pathogens in flaviviruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
