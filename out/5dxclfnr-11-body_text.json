In addition to this, the infection is accompanied by cytoskeletal changes facilitating filopodia formation and thus membrane fusion. The filopodia formation leads to the activation of Rho-GTPase signaling [28] . The PI3K signaling pathway seems to be involved in both, as inhibition prior to infection blocks Rho-GTPase signaling, reduces filopodia formation and thus RhoA activity [29] . Activation of signaling events typical of macropinocytosis also seems to be activated directly, following cellular entry of the highly pathogenic African swine fever virus. This virus not only induces two critical effectors, Pak1 and Rac1, which link Rho-GTPases to cytoskeleton reorganization and thus membrane perturbations and actin remodeling, but also to the EGFR and PI3K/Akt pathway. Consequently, specific inhibitors of EGFR, i.e., 324674 or the phytoestrogen genistein, as well as inhibition of PI3K with LY294002, analyzed by the phosphorylation status of its specific substrate PIP 2 , efficiently reduced viral uptake [30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
