This can either occur by absorbing neutralising antibodies or by modulating the immune response to target non-neutralising epitopes. The GP gene of Ebola virus contains a poly-U stutter region that drives transcriptional frame-shifting that generates three glycoproteins: a dimeric secreted GP (sGP) that accounts for approximately 75% of transcripts, the full-length membrane-bound fusion protein (GP) accounting for~25% of transcripts, and trace levels of a small soluble GP (ssGP) [17, 109] . Whilst the function of ssGP is yet unknown, sGP that is secreted by infected cells has been associated with viral immune evasion by acting as an antibody decoy [17] . Ebola sGP has been found to "antigenically subvert" the immune system, wherein sGP redirects the humoral immune response to target epitopes shared with the full-length GP. The study by Mohan et al. also demonstrated that sGP also subverts the host immune response of mice previously immunised with Ebola GP [17] . As the major antigenic transcript, most antibodies isolated from Ebola survivors and macaques are directed towards sGP rather than GP [110, 111] ; importantly these antibodies are likely to be non-neutralising and the neutralising antibodies elicited against GP may cross-react and be absorbed by the more abundant sGP [112] . The extent to which mimicry of the glycan component of GP by sGP contributes to the overall antigenic mimicry in immune decoy functions is unknown. However, given both that glycans have been shown to contribute to epitope formation on sGP/GP [113] , and that there is congruence in their glycan processing [11] , glycans are likely to be an important component of these functions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
