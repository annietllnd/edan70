Variation between animals was observed in all groups, this being greater in the FIP group ( Figure 1 ). In the latter, the within group variation for each cytokine was lower in the experimentally infected group (1.1b) than in natural infection (Group 1.1a), and so were the transcription levels overall (though not significantly so) (Table S2) . When comparing naturally and experimentally infected cats with FIP separately with the FECV-infected healthy cats, a significant difference was observed for the experimentally infected animals with FIP only for IL-6 which was transcribed at a higher level in cats with FIP ( Figure 1 ; Table 3 ). The IL-12p40:IL-10 mRNA ratio was assessed as an accepted indicator of the inflammatory balance of the immune system [32, 33] . This was overall significantly higher in cats with FIP (p = 0.047), indicating the balance is tipped towards a pro-inflammatory state. In fact, IL-10 levels were higher than IL-12 levels in each individual control cat, whereas in half of the naturally infected FIP cats IL-10 levels were lower than IL-12 levels. Experimental FIP cats were again in between the groups, with slightly higher IL-10 than IL-12 levels in all animals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
