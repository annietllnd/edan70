All of the existing structure is subject to editing around the leading edge. As the secondary structure calculations catch up to the calculated leading edge points, the leading edge has a chance to choose between recently formed secondary structure and a pseudoknot over the same length of sequence.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
