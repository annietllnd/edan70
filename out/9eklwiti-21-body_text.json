Due to the improper treatment of LRTIs, some infected patients may not be treated adequately because the responsible bacterium (such as S. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli) is resistant to available antibiotics, leaving physicians without a weapon to combat the illness [61, 62] . The prudent use of available antibiotics in patients and animals, giving them only when needed, with the correct diagnosis and etiologic understanding, and in the correct dosage, dose intervals and duration is imperative. Antimicrobial stewardship is based on this premise. Over 262 million courses of outpatient antibiotic therapy were prescribed in 2011 with half of those antibiotics being unnecessary [63] . The most inappropriate use is for acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis. Further research into rapid, patient-friendly, inexpensive, and accessible diagnostic modalities to appropriately characterize LRTIs as bacterial versus viral versus other is necessary to harness antibiotic use. In addition, determination of the causative bacterial pathogen will further antibiotic stewardship programs, lowering the risk of propagating resistance and unwanted adverse events including the development of C. difficile. The advancements noted above are certainly moving in the right direction to understanding the etiology of pneumonia in a rapid manner, but development still continues for even faster, more comprehensive testing.
