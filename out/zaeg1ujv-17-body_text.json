Interestingly, some cells infected with these mutants yielded fiber-like structures containing only the VP6 protein ( Fig. 5E and F). One possibility is that the appearance of these structures depends on the relative concentration of nonphosphorylated NSP5 in virus-infected cells. Similar VP6 fibers are normally formed when VP6 is overexpressed in cells in the absence of other viral proteins (33, 34) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
