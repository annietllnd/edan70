In agreement with this proposal, frameshifting is common in mitochondrial genes, and genome size seems to correlate with the abundance of frameshifting (Seligmann, 2010) . In fact, some organisms display a high complexity in frameshifting: In the dinoflagellate Perkinsus marinus, the mitochondrial gene that encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 can shift up to 10 times within the same mRNA sequence in order to produce the correct gene product (Masuda et al., 2010) . Clearly, such complex frameshifting requires efficient regulatory control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
