We have previously proposed a model of the hierarchical NSP5 hyperphosphorylation associated with the assembly of viroplasms that involves a three-step mechanism: (i) an initial interaction of nonphos- phorylated NSP5 with NSP2 (or VP2), (ii) phosphorylation of Ser67 by CK1‚ê£ (this step does not take place when NSP5 is expressed alone), and (iii) hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 triggered by Ser67 phosphorylation that requires the 18-aa-long C-terminal tail (24) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
