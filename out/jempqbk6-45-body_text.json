Bacteria have already been observed to donate their genes to phages [78] , which leads to accelerated evolutionary rates in the latter. It is also noted that massive HGT between bacteria and their phages is likely to be a common phenomenon [78] . Here, we observe that phages co-infecting the same or related hosts can exchange genetic information (e.g., phage integrase family).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
