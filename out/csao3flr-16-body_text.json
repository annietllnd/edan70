Briefly, the HA1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pFastBacI vector (Invitrogen). To facilitate protein secretion and purification, an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal 6 Ã— His-tag were fused to the HA1 gene. The recombinant bacmid was transfected into Sf21 insect cells, and the protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Health Care). The HA and NA genes of H7N9-AH are stocked by our lab. The remaining 11 viral HA1 genes were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis in the RBS with the H7N9-AH strain according to the gene alignment results in Fig. 1b .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
