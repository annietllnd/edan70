The M1 protein sequence of H5N2 influenza A/chicken/Vietnam/ OIE-2215/2012 was from NCBI GenBank (accession number BAP71888.1). Genes were codon optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells and biochemically synthesized (Gen-Script, USA). Full-length HA, NA, and M1 genes were individually cloned into pcDNA3.1 (-) plasmids under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Invitrogen). The HA, NA and M1 genes, from the CMV promoter to the bovine growth hormone (BGH) poly A site, were amplified by PCR and cloned into pFastBac1-HERV plasmid. The primers for PCR are shown in S1 Table. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). The scheme for constructing the recombinant baculoviruses, AcHERV-HA and AcHERV-VLP, is shown in Fig 1. After propagation in Sf9 cells, the amplified recombinant baculoviruses in supernatant were loaded on top of 30% sucrose, and purified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour in a 50.2Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The virus pellet was re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at -80°C until use.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
