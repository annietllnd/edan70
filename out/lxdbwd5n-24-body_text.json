Glycyrrhetinic acid treatment enhances plasma insulin levels and reduces the levels of gluconeogenic enzymes in liver. It is a pentacyclic triterpene acid with numerous biological activities, including anti-inflammatory [63] , antiviral [64] , antiallergic [65] , and antitumor proliferative effects [66] . Glycyrrhetinic acid restrains the proliferation of skin tumors in mice and human breast cancer cells (MCF7) and induces apoptosis of cancer cells. The mechanism of apoptosis might be via increased free Ca 2+ level in the cells [111] . Mizushina et al. [112] demonstrated that glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the activity of mammalian polymerases, including pol . Glycyrrhetinic acid also reduced TNFproduction and NF-B activation and suppressed mouse ear inflammation stimulated by tissue plasminogen activator. Therefore, glycyrrhetinic acid could be an anti-inflammatory agent based on pol inhibition.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
