UPS is also promoted and utilized by CVB3 infection (Luo et al., 2003b; Gao et al., 2008) . Therefore, similar to the finding that CVB3 promotes the degradation of cyclin D (Luo et al., 2003b) , it is possible that the reduced abundance of cyclin E is the result of its up-regulated degradation through UPS in the cells expressing VP1 or infected with CVB3. However, this mechanism cannot explain the accumulation of Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1 . A recent study demonstrated that the ubiquitination of p27 Kip1 by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH7/UBE2L3 stabilizes p27 Kip1 while other Cdk inhibitors are not affected (Whitcomb et al., 2019) , suggesting that there is an intricate mechanism which controls p27 Kip1 . In consistent with our finding, the up-regulation of Hsp70 and p27 Kip1 has been reported in the cells with G1 arrest induced by radiation (Seo et al., 2006) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
