The genus Gammaretrovirus belongs to the subfamily Orthoretrovirinae in the family Retroviridae, and encompasses endogenous retroviruses with a simple genome organization [45] . These positive-sense enveloped viruses have an RNA genome encoding three proteins: gag (involved in viral protein synthesis), pol (corresponding to the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase enzyme) and env (the viral glycoprotein), flanked by a long terminal repeat (LTR) at the 59 and 39 ends. Endogenous retroviruses correspond to integrated proviruses infecting germline cells and propagated by vertical transmission, occurring as either expressed or silent genomes (partially or completely defective) [46, 47] . In our study, several contig and read sequences with HSPs related to pol and env gammaretrovirus proteins were identified for specimen b7 (Eptesicus serotinus) ( Table 3 ). The presence of gammaretroviral sequences was further confirmed in analyses of the lungs sample from this specimen, in PCR with specific primers based on the largest contig sequences matching the pol gene (Table 3 and Fig. 5A ). Phylogenetic analysis performed on a selected region (155 aa) of the translated pol sequence obtained from the PCR product demonstrated that this virus, identified as Sers gammaretrovirus, belonged to the genus Gammaretrovirus, but differed from other members of this genus, including those recently identified in bats (Fig. 5B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
