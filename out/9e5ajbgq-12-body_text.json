The basic oral assessment of every child was performed by a single, well-trained professional dentist by seating each subject on a chair in a good day light using mouth mirror and dental probes. This simple oral examination poses no harm to children. The intra-examiner reliability was good based on re-examination of 30 children prior to the study (kappa value = 0.98). Caries status in the crown of primary teeth was assessed using decayed (d), missing (m), and filled (f) teeth (dmft) index [2, 13] ; teeth missing (m) or filled (f) contributed to the overall dmft score only if they were missing or filled because of caries. A dmft score above null indicates the presence of caries, whereas a null score indicates the absence of caries [13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
