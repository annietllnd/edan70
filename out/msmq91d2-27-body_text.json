To know whether rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs can inhibit IFN-b gene up-regulation, type-I IFN-competent MEF cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12, rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs at a m.o.i of 3, and total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi. Accumulation of mouse IFN-b, ISG56 mRNA, RVFV antiviralsense S-segment RNA and N mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot as described previously [51, 62] . Cells infected with rMP12-C13type induced IFN-b and ISG56 mRNA, while those infected with MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce IFN-b and ISG56 mRNA synthesis (Fig. 5) . These results suggest that both PTV and SFSV NSs inhibit the accumulation of IFN-b mRNA, consistent with previous studies [34, 48] . Taken together, the results suggest that rMP12-PTNSs inhibits both host general transcription and IFN-b mRNA synthesis and that rMP12- SFSNSs inhibits IFN-b mRNA synthesis but not host general transcription.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
