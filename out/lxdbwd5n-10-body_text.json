GA can suppress systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation via inhibition of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) production by PMN. It may also have the potential to inhibit anti-inflammatory responseassociated opportunistic infections in critically ill patients with severe SIRS [49] . There are also other studies that indicated the same anti-inflammatory mechanisms of GA [50] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
