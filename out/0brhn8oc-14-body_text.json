The MMTV pseudoknot forms a compact structure of two guanine/cytosine-rich A-form helices. The MMTV pseudoknot has a bend of approximately 60ยบ between the two helices, caused by an unpaired adenine that intercalates between the helices and may act as a hinge. Subsequent structural and functional studies of several variants of the MMTV pseudoknot reveal that the intercalated nucleotide and the resulting bend between stems 1 and 2 are required for effi cient frameshifting [28] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
