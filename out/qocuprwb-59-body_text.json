However, it is uncertain if the low level of TNF-α in the spleen directly contributed to the subsequent CNS infection and the neuropathogenesis during JaTH160 infection. It is important to note that there were 17 amino acid differences in the genomic sequences of JaTH160 and JaOArS982. Therefore, it will be important to determine whether or not specific amino acid substitutions can influence TNF-α expression and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of the lethal process during JaTH160 infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
