As poly (ICLC) stimulates IL-12 it would theoretically be an effective adjuvant for generating cross-protective antibodies thus expanding the number of people that could be immunized. Use of poly (ICLC) as an adjuvant requires lower doses than when used solely for prophylaxis [54] , thus alleviating some of the toxicity concerns associated with their use.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
