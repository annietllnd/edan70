Figure S1 Gel electrophoresis of RT-qPCR products from pooled-monthly samples. qPCR products were amplified using the primer sets listed in Table S2 Figure S4 Detection of the LSV genome by denaturing 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern blots using three LSV-specific probes. RNA (15 mg) extracted from the supernatants of homogenized honey bees was transferred to a membrane and probed using LSV-specific probes corresponding to different regions of the genome (P1 -1482-1744, P2 -2289-2477, and P3 -4509-4714) as described in Materials and Methods. (TIFF) Figure S5 Detection of the replicative form of LSV1 and LSV2 by negative strand-specific RT-PCR. The pooled July RNA sample was analyzed for the presence of LSV negativestrand RNA, which is indicative of virus replication, using strandspecific RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods; RT-PCR products from reactions were analyzed by agarose (2%) gel electrophoresis.

Light microscopy of live parasites was performed using a Leica DM6000 microscope (1006 objective) equipped with Hamamatsu C4742-95 camera and Volocity Software (PerkinElmer).
