Despite many complex studies carried out over the years, understanding of the disease is still far from complete. The answer to such a challenge might be the use of high-throughput analysis tools, like DNA microarrays or deep sequencing, to study transcriptional response of the host after virus infection. Most of such studies included only Type 2 PRRSV strains [23] [24] [25] , while only single ones enrolled Type 1 strains [26] . Even recently published data on the virulence of subtype 2 strains of Type 1 showed that some of those strains may characterize with high pathogenicity which implies distinct mechanisms shaping the course of infection [18] . However, transcriptional response to infection by subtype 2 strains of Type 1 PRRSV was not studied before. The aim of a present study was to shed a light on the host-virus interactions during the course of infection with PRRSV strains of commonly present in Central and Western Europe subtype 1 and much less studied subtype 2 strains. The biological material analysed in the present study was collected in the first animal experiment with the use of such strains [18] . Changes in expression of genes involved in immunological processes were evaluated in each infected group of pigs and compared to control pigs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
