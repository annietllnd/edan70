Freshly isolated brains and spleens were immediately immersed in RNAlater (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression levels of cytokines were measured by real time-PCR as demonstrated previously [52] . The copy numbers were calculated as a ratio of the copy numbers of internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenate.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
