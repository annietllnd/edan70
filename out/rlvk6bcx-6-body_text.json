Facultative pathogens are primarily environmental bacteria and fungi that can occasionally cause infection. They include many of the most problematic hospital-acquired bacteria involved in the antimicrobial resistance pandemic. A distinction is sometimes made between facultative and accidental pathogens, with the latter representing those which only occasionally infect weakened or immunocompromised hosts. Typical examples of 'accidental' pathogens include Neisseria meningitidis or Escherichia coli.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
