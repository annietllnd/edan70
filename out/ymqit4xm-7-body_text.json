If the absorbance rate was lower than the control, this was considered to indicate a reduction in cell proliferation. By contrast, if the absorbance rate was higher, this indicated an increase in cell proliferation. The difference in the inhibition rate between the groups was analyzed using one-way analysis of covariance. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
