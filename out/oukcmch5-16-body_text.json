Before infection cells were pre-loaded with FDG by hypotonic shock. After 100 min incubation of cells with virus at 37uC, cells were collected and the amount of FIC generated as a results of enzyme complementation analyzed by FACS. The fusion assay showed that silencing of neither CAV1 nor CAV2 affected MHV fusion ( Figure 3A , light blue), even though reduction of CAV2 was shown to affect MHV infection ( Figure 1C ). However, downregulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis associated pro- teins DNM2 and CLTC lead to strongly decreased fusion, as did the lack of early endosome-associated factors RAB5B and RAB5C ( Figure 3A , dark blue and cerulean, respectively). Fusion was also affected by RNAi-mediated reduction of actin cytoskeletonassociated proteins ACTR2 and ACTR3 ( Figure 3A , dark orange), proteins known to be involved in late endosome (RAB7A, RAB7B) and late endosome-to-lysosome maturation (VPS11, VPS39, and VPS41) ( Figure 3A , turquoise and light green).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
