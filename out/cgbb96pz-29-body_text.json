The nuclear pore and the cellular process of nuclear trafficking are both common targets of antagonism and utilization by viruses [33] . One can imagine intense selective pressure at play to keep viruses out of cells altogether via receptor evolution [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] or, when that fails, out of the nucleus via evolution of the nuclear transport machinery. It's possible that nuclear pore components, like cellular entry receptors, are another class of host cofactor proteins that often create critical barriers to viral host switching, thus driving viral evolution in the process. RanBP2 adds to a growing list of dynamic cellular host proteins that exert selective pressure during the spillover of viruses in nature [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
