First, one has to identify in mRNAs the requirements for a productive frameshift peptide: One might argue that a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot are a good predictor of frameshifting events, but-as pointed out above-there are alternative mechanisms that result in frameshifting (see also Figure 2 ). For identification of the frameshifted products, I propose three hallmarks: first, the presence of an initiation triplet (AUG or CUG) and a stop codon in +1 or âˆ’1 frame; second, a stable peptide that follows the 50-nt rule (Nagy and Maquat, 1998; Hillman et al., 2004) ; and third, the validation that the peptide is endogenously expressed. Validation can be done by low-throughput experimental methods, either using antibodies raised against the frameshifted protein or using genetic manipulations that ablate the frameshift protein without disrupting the zero frame protein, if possible. To identify frameshifting on a genome-wide scale, higher throughput approaches can be applied, such as genomic, phenotypic, or proteomic screening.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
