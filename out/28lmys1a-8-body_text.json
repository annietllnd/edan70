This economic model was developed in Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) utilizing @RISK and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). The base herd used included 1500 milking cows, 1000 replacement heifers in total and 84 heifer calves in the pre-weaning period, assuming a 30% replacement rate and an average age at first calving of 25 months. Costs were calculated on a per head basis for housing, feed, labor, mortality, and health. All remaining variables are static. Interest was accounted for on infrastructure and mortality as well as the depreciation of assets related to replacement females. Costs associated with herd-wide parameters, such as disease prevalence and mortality rates, were distributed across all remaining calves in the pre-weaning phase. The model required a management decision at 3 points: housing type, milk source, and labor shown in Figure 1 . Three main housing types were modeled: individual housing outside (IHO), individual housing inside (IHI) [10] , and group housing (GH). Three milk sources were built into the model: whole milk (WM), pasteurized whole milk (PWM), or milk replacer (MR). Four possible liquid feeding plans were modeled: 6, 8, 10, and 12 L of milk per calf per day. Labor was modeled for two categories: conventional, where a person was assigned to feeding and caring for the calves; or automatic, where an automatic calf feeder was utilized in addition to human labor. Totals costs were reported per calf for each management decision, the entire pre-weaning period per calf, and per day per calf. Per day cost was calculated by dividing days of age at weaning by the total cost per calf during the pre-weaning period.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
