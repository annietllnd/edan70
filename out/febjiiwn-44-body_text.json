Honey bees were immobilized by chilling at 4uC for 20 minutes, briefly washed in 70% ethanol, and decapitated prior to dissection. The SF strain was isolated from honey bee intestines dissected in a sterile environment, minced and placed in a T25 flask and cultured in BHT medium composed of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) 28.8 g/L (DIFCO), tryptose 4.5 g/L (DIFCO), glucose 5.0 g/L, Na 2 HPO 4 0.5 g/L, KCl 0.3 g/L, hemin 1.0 mg/L, fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated) 2% v/v, pH 6.5, and containing penicillin G sodium (10 6 units/L) and streptomycin sulfate (292 mg/L) at 27uC [101] . Free active Crithidias were observed 24 hours post inoculation. Parasites were maintained by subculture passage every 4 days; stable liquid nitrogen stocks were archived. Light microscopy of live parasites was performed using a Leica DM6000 microscope equipped with Hamamatsu C4742-95 camera and Volocity Software (PerkinElmer). Imaging fixed parasites (4% paraformaldehyde, 20 min) facilitated visualization of DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) stained nuclear and kinetoplast DNA. Images of fixed Crithidia mellificae were obtained using both the Leica DM6000 microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510-M microscope equipped with both a 636 objective numerical aperture 1.4, and a 1006 objective numerical aperture 1.4.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
