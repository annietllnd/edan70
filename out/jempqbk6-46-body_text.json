The first group of methods is based on the analysis of a reliable phylogenetic tree of the protein family: any event in this tree that contradicts the species tree is a candidate for HGT [79] . The second group of methods relies on the analysis of the sequence statistics and special features that can be evidence for HGT if not typical for the considered species [80] [81] [82] . The simplest, but practical statistical measure is the GC content of the corresponding nucleotide segment. Application of these different tools to the identification of HGT events in viruses encounters difficulties, both rooted in the methodology and caused by the biology of the subject.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
