Among these, the mosquito-borne species include important human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, affecting about onethird of the world population, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Currently, there is no effective antiviral drug available for all flaviviruses, and vaccines are lacking for DENV and WNV. The 10-11 kilo-base positive-sense flavivirus RNA genome contains both 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs) and a single open reading frame that is translated into a large polyprotein. The genome bears a cap 1 structure ( N7Me G59-ppp-59A 29OMe ) at its 59 end [1] , while its 39 end is not poly-adenylated. The polyprotein is processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. Among those, the <900-residue non-structural protein 5 (NS5) comprises an Nterminal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) domain, and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) region that harbors the classic thumb, palm, and fingers domains present in all single-subunit polymerases. Although MTase is common for viruses bearing a 59 cap structure and RdRP is required for all RNA viruses, the flavivirus NS5 represents a unique natural fusion of these two important enzymes. However, whether and how inter-regulations and cooperativity take place between the two enzymes of NS5 remain elusive.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
