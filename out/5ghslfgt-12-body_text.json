As of 13 February 2020, Guangdong has 1241 reported cases [1] , so forecasts predict an additional 49-63 cases in the next 5 days. Upper bounds (UB) of 95% prediction intervals for both the GLM and Richards model suggest that up to 1392 cases could accumulate, while the sub-epidemic prediction intervals are substantially wider and include up to 1699 cases; this translates to an additional 151-458 additional cases by 18 February 2020.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
