However, either SARS-CoV infection or SARS-CoV spike protein overexpression does not lead to XBP1 splicing [20] , suggesting the modulation of UPR branches differs for different coronaviruses. Interestingly, when the E gene is deleted from the SARS-CoV genome, the resulting mutant virus (rSARS-CoV-âˆ†E) is significantly attenuated, but significantly activates XBP1 splicingand up-regulates other cellular stress genes, leading to increased apoptosis [38] . The study suggests that SARS-CoV E protein suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway activation and inhibits apoptosis induction, although the mechanism remains unknown.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
