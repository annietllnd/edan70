At 24 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and cell extracts were incubated with either rabbit or mouse IgG, eVP40, or mVP40 specific antisera as indicated. Protein A or G agarose beads were then added to the mixtures and incubated overnight at 4ËšC. After incubation, beads were collected via centrifugation and washed 4X. Proteins were then detected by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-BAG3 (Proteintech), polyclonal anti-His (Cell Signaling), or monoclonal anti-cmyc (Millipore) antisera as indicated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
