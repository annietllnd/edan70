The generalized logistic growth model (GLM) and the Richards model extend the simple logistic growth model with an additional scaling parameter [9, 11, 13] . We also apply a sub-epidemic model, which accommodates complex epidemic trajectories, such as multiple peaks and sustained or damped oscillations, by assembling the contribution of inferred overlapping sub-epidemics [10] . Appendix A includes a detailed description of the models and their parameters.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
