Antibodies were raised against the C-terminus of the proteins by using 14 amino acid long synthetic peptides with an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminus coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier (see supplemental  Table S1 ). All antisera had been determined by the supplier by ELISA to have a titre greater than 1:10,000 when tested against the peptide antigen. Antibody specificity was confirmed by ELISA and dot blot, using recombinant cytokines where available (human IL-1β and TNF-α (Peprotech, London, UK); feline IL-6 (Serotec (now Bio-Rad, Oxford, UK)); feline IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-12 (R&D Systems, Zug, Switzerland), and following routine protocols. Immunoblotting was also performed following routine protocols on a homogenised liver sample from an experimental FIP cat to confirm reaction with the 'native' protein. The antibodies were subsequently used in immunohistology. As IL-6 specificity could not be confirmed in the Western blot system, a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against feline IL-6 (MAB23051, R&D Systems) that became commercially available following completion of the initial liver study was tested on a small set of liver samples. This antibody has been previously published [40] and served here to further confirm IL-6 protein expression in the myocardium.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
