HCT has been widely used in China, Japan and other Asian countries as a medicine due to its anti-inflammatory properties (8) . Previous studies have demonstrated that HCT has anti-inflammatory effects in a wide range of diseases (8) (9) (10) (11) . During the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in 2008 in China, HCT was used as a therapeutic drug (12) . Several studies demonstrated that HCT inhibited enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16, which are the two main causative agents of HFMD (13, 14) . It has also been demonstrated that HCT water extract was able to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (8, 15, 16) and herpes simplex virus infection (17) . Sodium houttuyfonate (SH), an addition compound of sodium bisulfite and houttuynia, is the stable form of houttuynia and exhibits the same effect as HCT. Certain studies have demonstrated that SH has an antibacterial effect against 21 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (18) and it has previously been used for the treatment of cationic bovine serum albumin-induced membranous glomerulonephritis in BALB/c mice (19) . Previous studies have also demonstrated that SH exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) pathway (20) , which led to the hypothesis that SH may also be effective for the treatment of RA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
