Conversely, significant upregulation of UPR genes (such as ERdj4 and p58 IPK ) can be detected in cells infected with IBV, indicating full activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway [37] . Moreover, RNA interference of IRE1 and inhibition of XBP1s drastically potentiate IBV-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of IRE1 and XBP1s promotes cell survival, pointing to an anti-apoptotic nature of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway during IBV infection [37] . Activation of a pro-survival response at the late stage of infection could benefit the virus, by giving more time for virus particle assembly and release before the infected cells are disintegrated. However, knockdown of IRE1 does not significantly affect the production of infectious IBV in the supernatant [37] . Therefore, the physiological significance of IRE1 during coronavirus infection needs to be determined with further experiments and with appropriate in vivo models.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
