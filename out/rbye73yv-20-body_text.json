By structural determination, it was shown that MERS-4 Fab and MERS-4V2 scFv share the same mode of binding to the RBD (Figure 4(B) ) [39] . Analysis of the RBD/MERS-4V2 complex structure showed that the antibody contacts with the β5-β6, β6-β7 and β7-β8 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain in RBD [39] . The epitope involves Leu507, Ser508, Gln516, Asn519, Asn521, Gln522, Tyr523, Pro525, Lys543, Leu545, and Gly550 [39] . To be note, the MERS-4 epitope has no overlap with DPP4-binding site (Figure 4(C) ). By approaching the RBD outside the DPP4-binding site, MERS-4 recognizes a unique epitope different from all previously reported RBD-targeting antibodies. Comparisons of RBD in DPP4-bound and MERS-4-bound states revealed that binding of MERS-4 induces or fixes the β5-β6 loop into a conformation in which it folds into a shallow groove on the RBD interface critical for accommodating a short helix of DPP4, thereby indirectly disrupting the interaction between RBD and DPP4 (Figure 4(C) ). Such different epitope and mechanism enable MERS-4 to synergize with other antibodies including RBD-targeting MERS-27 and m336 in neutralization, which provides valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection [39] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
