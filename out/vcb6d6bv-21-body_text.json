These residues are extremely unfavorable within the lipid bilayer. Their presence in TM segments is significantly abated (Figure 4) [14] . As a consequence, their contribution to the folding/packing of TM segments will be limited. However, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are Figures 1 and 2) . Viroporin hydrophobic regions were analyzed jointly (darkest blue) and separately by class (lighter blues).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
