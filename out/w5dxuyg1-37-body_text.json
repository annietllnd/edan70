The study aimed to maximise the information gleaned from previous unrelated experimental infections and case collections by utilising these tissues to tackle the hypotheses. Results obtained from the liver study provided a springboard to studying the heart, for which retrospective samples were available. They are presented together here as it was felt that, combined, the results add more to our knowledge of potential pathogenesis. This of course comes with the limitation of inter-group matching, hence we have drawn broad rather than highly specific conclusions and the groups have not been compared between organs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
