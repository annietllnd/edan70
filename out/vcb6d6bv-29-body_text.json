Before the resolution of the protein structure, the TM domain was already identified as responsible for the channel tetramerization [89] and proton transport activity [90] . There has been some controversy on the role of the cytoplasmic amphiphilic helix in both processes. However, several studies showed that mutations/deletions of the membrane proximal helix had no effect on surface expression levels or proton transport; the only change being its inability to promote membrane scission and virion release [87, 91] . All in all, these results show the M2 TM domain as necessary and sufficient for tetramer formation and proton conductance.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
