HEK293T cells were transfected with eVP40-WT, eVP40-ΔPT/PY or flag-tagged-mVP40, respectively. At 24 hours after transfection, the cell extracts were incubated with the GSH beads described above at 4˚C for 4 hours with continuous rotating. The proteins complexes were pulled down with beads via centrifugation. The rabbit eVP40 antiserum (PROSCI), mouse anti-flag monoclonal antibody (SIGMA), mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (SIGMA) were used to detect eVP40-WT, eVP40-ΔPT/PY, mVP40, GST, or GST-BAG3 WW proteins in input and pulldown samples by Western blotting.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
