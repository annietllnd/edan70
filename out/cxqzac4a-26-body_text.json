When considering the application of microarray technology, data analysis is a significant obstacle to users without specialized knowledge in bioinformatics analysis of microarray data and nucleic Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasma Parasite Figure 1 Hybridization picture of EOPM in the adenovirus outbreak case. RNA/DNA from patients was labeled with red cy5 fluorescent dye, and nucleic acid from normal control serum was labeled with green cy3 dye. acid sequences. Therefore, we implemented the statistical enrichment analysis in a user-friendly interface (Figure 2 ). The software can support a large-scale search of probe hits against a comprehensive microbial sequence database. We believe this software will greatly facilitate the installation of the EOPM platform in different infectious surveillance system laboratories in China.
