In humans, chimpanzees, and Rhesus monkeys, this locus encodes 25, 18, and 24 CEACAM/PSG genes, respectively, in a 10-Mbp region on chromosome 19 ( Fig. 1a , Table S1 in File S1). These primate CEACAM/PSG genes can be physically divided into two clusters. The cluster I contained the better characterized CEACAM1,3-8 and PSG genes whereas the second cluster included the recently identified CEACAM16, 18-20, and 22-23 genes (Fig. 1a) . Although the total number of CEACAM/PSG genes in Rhesus monkeys was close to that of humans, the majority of PSG-like genes in this primate did not show a 1:1 orthologous relationship with those of apes. Instead, phylogenetic tree analysis using either Neighbor-Joining or Maximum Likelihood methods showed that most PSG-like genes in Rhesus monkeys clustered in a sub-branch in phylogenetic trees, suggesting that the expansion of PSG genes in Rhesus monkeys was independent of those in apes (Figs. 2a and 3a).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
