The mutant proteins were purified by nickel affinity column as detailed in the earlier section. The eluted protein from nickel affinity purification was then injected into Superose 12 analytical gel filtration column, preequilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT. Analytical gel filtration was performed with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT as buffer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
