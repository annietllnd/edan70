Analysis of the growth kinetics of each mutant in Vero E6 cell supernatants (Fig. 1A ) was used to determine their requirement for replication. Cell-associated virus was also analyzed at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi), showing results similar to those observed for the released virus (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The Δ3a and ΔE mutants grew to lower titers than the parental wild-type (wt) virus (Fig. 1A) . However, while the ΔE mutant showed 100-fold-lower titers (around 8 ϫ 10 5 PFU/ml), Δ3a titers decreased slightly (3-fold) (3 ϫ 10 7 PFU/ml). These results show that both proteins were required for optimal virus replication in cell culture. In contrast, the Δ8a virus reached peak titers (9 ϫ 10 7 PFU/ml) similar to those observed for the parental virus.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
