The resulting plasmid, pET26b-Ub-JEV-NS5, was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pCG1 for expression where NS5 was initially produced as an ubiquitin fusion protein that was cleaved in vivo by a coexpressed ubiquitin-specific carboxyl terminal protease Ubp1 to produce full-length NS5 with the native N-terminal residue [44] and a C-terminal GSSS-His66 tag. Cells were grown at 31.5uC overnight in NZCYM medium with 50 mg/ml kanamycin (KAN), 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol (CHL), and 0.5% (w/v) D-glucose until the OD 600 was 1.0. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of NZCYM medium with 50 mg/ml KAN, 20 mg/ml CHL to reach an initial OD 600 around 0.025. The cells were grown at 37uC at 250 rpm to an OD 600 of 1.0 and then cooled to room temperature (r.t.). Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the cells were grown for an additional 4 h before harvesting.
