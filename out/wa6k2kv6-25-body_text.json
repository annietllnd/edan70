Beijing is located in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, where influenza typically peaks seasonally once a year, and Beijing experience one peak of influenza activity and the peak occurred during December-January next year before 2009 [3, 26, 27] , but ahead to November in 2009 [17, 26] . That the peaks in ILI and the increase in acute respiratory infections (ARI) are due to influenza is supported by the seasonal pattern of highprobability ILI, the low level of respiratory syncytial virus infections, and laboratory results in the influenza season [23, 28, 29] . During the 2010-11 influenza season, a seasonal pattern in ILI activity was observed and influenza activity peaked in late January 2011 in Beijing. Compared with the previous pandemic year (2009), lower outpatient numbers were observed during 2010-11( Figure 2) . Overall, the rates of influenza-like illnesses in outpatients were lower during the 2010-2011 season, than during the 2009-10 pandemic influenza season ( Figure 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
