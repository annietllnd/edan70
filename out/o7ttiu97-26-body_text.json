Animals were fed food and water ad libitum except 4 h prior to and during CT/PET imaging. On day 0, ferrets were anesthetized prior to inoculation with virus or PBS with ketamine, dexmedetomidine and atropine. Eight animals were inoculated i.n. with 0.5 mL of infectious virus per naris as a bolus, which was diluted to 10 6.0 TCID 50 /mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Four ferrets were inoculated i.n. with 0.5 mL PBS per naris as a mock-infected control. For imaging, on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6, anesthetic induction and maintenance were achieved with 1-3% isoflurane. Blood glucose levels were checked prior to administration of the radiolabeled tracer to ensure that they were within normal limits, which typically range from 62-134 mg/dL in ferrets [47] . Glucose was provided to animals to compensate for body fluids lost during imaging. Typically 30 mls of Lactated Ringer's solution (Hospira) was administered subcutaneously (s.q.) following completion of the imaging. Animals were monitored for body temperature and vital signs during imaging.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
