We showed that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor binding subdomain. MERS-CoV RBD and the related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor binding subdomains [36] . The receptor binding subdomain of MERS-CoV RBD directly interacts with blades 4 and 5 of DPP4 propeller instead of its intrinsic hydrolase domain. The interface consists of a buried surface of ∼2550 Å 2 involving 14 residues in receptor binding subdomain interacting with 15 residues in DPP4. The actual binding forces are mediated through two major binding patches. Patch 1 represents 49% of buried surface and forms between the C-terminal end of the long loop connecting the β6 and β7 strands and blade 4 of DPP4. Patch 2 occupies 51% of buried surface and forms a slightly concaved outer surface at the far end of the MERS-CoV receptor binding subdomain and a linker containing a short helix between blade 4 and blade 5 of DPP4. The concaved outer surface is made by the short β6 strand, C-terminal parts of β5 and β7 strands, N-terminal part of β8 strand and the β5-β6 linking loop. It is hoped that better understanding of the atomic details of the spike glycoprotein, as well as the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 will provide the structural basis for rational design and development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.
