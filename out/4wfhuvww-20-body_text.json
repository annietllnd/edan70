Such predictions are based on primary mRNA sequence stretches or on secondary hairpins or pseudo-knots within the mRNA sequence. For instance, Hammell et al. searched the genome for slippery sequences and pseudoknot FIGURE 3 | Methods to detect frameshifting events and out-of-frame peptides. Computational methods (1) using databases that interrogate the genome for âˆ’1 or +1 frameshift motifs can give information about frameshifting events. Limitations of this approach are that only known frameshift motifs are taken into account. Furthermore, this method does not give any information whether predicted frameshift events occur in vivo or the functional relevance of frameshifting events. Experimental methods (2) can identify frameshift events that occur in vivo. Most commonly, an antibody that is specific to the out-of-frame sequence of the frameshifted protein is used to detect frameshifted proteins. Ribosome profiling methods such as Ribo-Seq (3) can be used to detect out-of-frame peptides on a genomic scale. cDNA screening and the use of tandem luciferase reporter constructs (4) can be used to experimentally detect frameshift events. Limitations of this approach are that overexpression may result in dysregulated expression and differences in translation compared to endogenous expression levels. Proteomic methods (5) using mass spectrometry are suitable to detect endogenous out-of-frame peptides. However, the levels of frameshifted proteins may be low and escape the detection limit. A combination of these methods may provide most suitable to identify out-of-frame proteins on a genome-wide scale. See text for details.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
