The cells were maintained at 37ËšC, 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly. PRRSV-2 isolate NVSL 98-7895 (GenBank accession no. AY545985.1) was used in all experiments as previously described [37] . Viral titration was performed via plaque assay. Briefly, MARC-145 cells were seeded in 12 well plates (Costar; Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) and grown until confluency. Once at confluency, cells were infected with PRRSV, for 1 hour in serum-free DMEM to allow attachment of viral particles. Following attachment, MARC-145 were overlaid with a solution of 2X MEM diluted 1:1 with 1.5% agarose. Infection was carried for 96h and plaques were revealed with neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA). Dr. R. M. Yates from University of Calgary generously provided both MARC-145 cell line and PRRSV-2 isolate NVSL 98-7895.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
