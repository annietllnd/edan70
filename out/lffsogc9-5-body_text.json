Within the avian coronavirus group, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is among the most researched. This virus is known to cause an important disease that incurs a high economic loss in the poultry industry [2, 3] despite an ongoing vaccination program. It causes respiratory disease while also affecting the kidneys and reproductive tract [4] through viremia with a severity that differs depending on serotypes [3] . Mutations and recombination have produced a high genetic diversity of the virus. In addition, vaccinations performed in the farm setting can influence the evolution of the virus [5] . Many serotypes of IBV are often not cross-protective [6, 7] . Mismatching between the circulating strain and the administered vaccine may contribute to vaccination failure [7] . Ubiquitous IBV and IBV-like viruses have also been found in species other than chicken, such as in peafowl, guinea fowl, partridge, waterfowl, and teal [2, 6, [8] [9] [10] . This finding strengthens the possibility that IBV may have a wider range of hosts than previously thought [8, 6] . Despite this, data relating to IBV in Indonesia is still limited to poultry. Studies of diseases on endemic species are valuable for the conservation effort, yet are rarely conducted.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
