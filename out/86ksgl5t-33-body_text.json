The transcriptional enrichment analysis indicated that IFN-λ3 or IFN-α is involved in the regulation of cellular processes, such as cellular components and molecular functions, in IPEC-J2 cells, and that IFN-λ3 activates more robust signaling pathways, particularly the antiviral Jak-STAT signaling pathway, compared with IFN-α. IFN-λ3 preferentially upregulates antiviral genes in epithelial cells compared with IFN-α. These results indicate that IFN-λ3 selectively targets small intestinal epithelial cells and induces a non-redundant antiviral host response at the enteric mucosal site.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
