Thus, we generated a version of IBV E that had a canonical signal sequence, followed by a FLAG tag on the N-terminus (ssFLAG-IBV E). When transiently expressed in HeLa cells, ssFLAG-IBV E was not targeted as well to the Golgi complex as the other constructs ( Figure  S3A ). Also, selective permeabilization showed that a larger portion of the N-terminus was in the cytoplasm compared to ssIBV E ( Figure  S3B ). These observations suggest that the FLAG tag may alter insertion and targeting when added behind a cleaved signal sequence. However, even with these caveats, ssFLAG-IBV E still disrupted trafficking similarly to IBV E and ssIBV E ( Figure S3D ). ssFLAG-IBV E also disrupted the Golgi complex, but to a lower degree than IBV E or ssIBV E, possibly due to less efficient targeting ( Figure S3C ). These results strongly support our interpretation of the importance of topology and IBV E function.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
