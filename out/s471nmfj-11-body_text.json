RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water and was quantified by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). About 1 µg of each total RNA preparation and 4 µl of 5× TransScript Allin-One SuperMix (TransGen, Beijing, China) were used in a total of 20 µl reverse transcription system. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on a LightCycler 96 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen, Beijing, China). Amplification of the cDNA was performed in triplicate, using 10 µl 2 × TransStrat Top Green qPCR SuperMix, 0.4 µl of each specific primer (10 µM), and 1 µl of cDNA. PCR program consisted of 5 min activation at 94 • C, followed by 40 cycles of 94 • C for 5 s, 55 • C for 10 s, and 72 • C for 10 s. Expression of the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for the normalization of all target RNAs. The relative changes of gene expression were determined by the 2 − Ct methods (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . The PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
