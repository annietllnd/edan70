Cultured isolates from clinical samples were directly subjected to PCR with species differentiation based on melting curve analysis; sequence variations underlying the probed regions of U. urealyticum and parvum result in separation of the melting temperature of the two species (Figures 1 and 2) . Results were compared to those of a previously described conventional PCR speciation method targeting the multiplebanded antigen using primers UMS-57 and UMA222 for U. parvum and UMS-170 and UMA263 for U. urealyticum [13] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
