Total RNA (1 Âµg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript TM II First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, China). The synthesized cDNA was subjected to qPCR performed in triplicate using a LightCycler R 480 II real-time PCR instrument (Roche, Switzerland) and SYBR Green PCR mix (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the data were acquired and analyzed using LightCycler R 480 II software 1.5 based on the cycle threshold ( CT) method (25) . GAPDH served as the internal control. The amplification efficiency of qPCR primers ranged from 85.83 to 106.38%. The primers used in this assay were designed using Primer Premier 5 software and are listed in Table 1 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
