(PDF) S1 Fig. CypA/RanCyp alignment and numbering reference. An alignment of human cyclophilin A (CypA) and human RanCyp. The full-length primary protein sequence of CypA is shown along with the RanCyp sequence that was used in this study for both functional and evolutionary analyses. Asterisks ( Ã ) represent sites that are conserved between CypA and Ran-Cyp. Secondary structure motifs (PDB: 4I9Y, α-alpha helix, β-beta strand) are denoted above the alignment. Amino acid alignment of cyclophilin A from primate species that encompass approximately 32 million years (Mya) of divergence time [51] . A cladogram representing the relationship between species is shown next to the alignment. (PDF)", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
