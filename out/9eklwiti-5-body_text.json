While it is the second most common nosocomial infection, accounting for 22% of all hospital-associated infections, it is the deadliest with case-fatality rates between 30% and 70% [10] . Approximately 20% (23/110) of nosocomial pneumonia infections do not have a pathogen reported. Among those with a pathogen reported, the most common cause of nosocomial pneumonia is S. aureus ( Figure 1 ). Even in HAP, generally considered to be less severe than ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), serious complications occur in approximately 50% of patients, including respiratory failure, pleural effusions, septic shock, renal failure, and empyema [11] . Based on data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011-2014, S. aureus accounts for 25% of VAP, making it the most common cause of VAP [12] . Other pathogens which lead to HAP/VAP include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteric Gram-negative bacilli, and Acinetobacter baumannii [13] . Identifying causative pathogens in acute bronchitis is also quite difficult, with <30% of cases having a causative pathogen [14] . Up to 10% of acute bronchitis is due to bacteria, including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, whereas approximately 90% of cases are due to viral infections such as adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and rhinovirus [15] . Bronchiolitis which occurs for the large part in infants is due to viral etiologies with the most common being RSV; most children have had an RSV infection by 2 years old [16].", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
