Statistical evidence for such an ancestral dual gene was found by analyzing the DNA sequences of modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases 32 . A hypothetical dual gene that exhibits a weak similarity to both synthetase classes was discovered in the mold Achlya klebsiana and several other organisms 33, 34 . The recent design of two overlapping synthetase genes [13] [14] [15] [16] also provides some support for this hypothesis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
