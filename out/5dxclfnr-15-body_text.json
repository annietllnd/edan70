Furthermore, SRSF1, SRSF7 and SRSF5 can directly be phosphorylated by Akt itself [36] [37] [38] (Figure 3) . . PI3K/Akt contribution to the regulation of alternative splicing and viruses utilizing the pathway for splicing regulation. After PI3K-mediated phosphorylation, Akt indirectly-through SRPK1/2-or directly phosphorylates SR proteins resulting in their translocation into the nucleus where they bind to corresponding pre-mRNAs. hnRNP proteins can also be targeted by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Measles virus (MV) interferes with PI3K activity, leading to altered SR protein phosphorylation and subsequently to the alternative splicing of a constitutively active isoform of the PIP 3 phosphatase SHIP, namely SIP110, which results in the down regulation of Akt activity (this route is marked with blue arrows). The adenovirus E4-ORF1 protein and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) control SR protein activity in support of viral replication either through modulating PP2A or SRPK1 activity. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) seems to depend on PI3K activity for accurate splicing of its own mRNA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
