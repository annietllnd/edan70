The effects of tulathromycin and PRRSV on macrophage differentiation and activation was determined via microscopic observations and cytokine quantification. MDMs were treated with tulathromycin (0.5 or 1 mg/mL) for 1 hour and infected with PRRSV (m.o.i. of 0.1) for 2, 4, 12 or 24h at 37˚C, 5% CO 2 . Supernantants were collected and frozen at -80˚C until processed and macrophages were stained with DiffQuick (Electron Microscopy sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and observed with a Nikon eclipse T300 microscope to assess morphological changes. Images were taken with a Retiga 2000x camera (Q imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) on a Leica DMR fluorescent microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and analyzed using ImageJ software. Individual macrophage morphology was assessed and classified as "resting" or "fibroblast-like" morphology. At least 150 macrophages per group in 3 independent experiments were assessed. Supernatants were processed to measure interleukin-8 (CXCL-8) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations using the porcine CXCL-8 Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; P8000, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and the IL-10 Quantikine ELISA (P1000, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) respectively. Samples were processed as per manufacturer's instructions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
