Cell extracts and supernatants were harvested as described above (Fig 6) . Appropriate expression levels for all proteins were confirmed by Western blotting of cell extracts (Fig 6, Cells) . We observed a clear dose-dependent inhibition of both eVP40 (Fig 6A and 6B ) and mVP40 (Fig 6D and 6E ) VLPs in the presence of increasing amounts of either BAG3-WT or BAG3-ΔC. In contrast, increasing expression of WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-ΔN had no effect on budding of either eVP40 or mVP40 VLPs (Fig 6C and 6F ). Once again, the level of inhibition mediated by BAG3-WT and BAG3-ΔC appeared to be more pronounced on mVP40 VLPs compared to that on eVP40 VLPs, with mVP40 VLPs being virtually undetectable in samples expressing the highest amounts of BAG3. Taken together, these results demonstrate a functional role for BAG3 as a negative regulator of eVP40 and mVP40 VLP budding via a WW-domain dependent mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first host WW-domain containing protein shown to inhibit filovirus VP40 egress.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
