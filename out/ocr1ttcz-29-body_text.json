Here, we developed an mtdVSV-based vaccine platform for ZIKV. We showed that a single dose of live attenuated VSVbased ZIKV vaccine expressing prM-E or prM-E-NS1 triggered strong ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses, and protected BALB/c and A129 mice against ZIKV challenge. In addition, we showed for the first time that NS1 protein modulates ZIKV-specific T cell immune responses and that NS1 alone conferred partial protection against ZIKV-induced viremia in BALB/c mice and lethal ZIKV challenge in A129 mice in the absence of a neutralizing antibody response. Altogether, these results demonstrated that this mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine is a highly promising candidate for ZIKV and highlighted that NS1 plays an important role in regulating immune responses against ZIKV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
