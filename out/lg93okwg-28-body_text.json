Interestingly, the L118A/I119A mutation in the interface of the coiled-coil dimer failed to disrupt FLASH dimerization but was sufficient to abolish the ability of FLASH to interact with Lsm11. The N-terminal Î±-helical region that mediates FLASH dimerization overlaps substantially with the core Lsm11 binding site in FLASH mapped to amino acids 100-140, prompting the hypothesis that Lsm11 may interact with a FLASH dimer. SEC-MALS experiments on the complex provided strong evidence that the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex is a 2:1 heterotrimer. While our AUC data confirmed that FLASH is a dimer, the stoichiometry of FLASH and Lsm11 in the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex was less clear, likely due to dissociation of Lsm11 NTD from the FLASH NTD dimer during prolonged ultracentrifugation. Some dissociation of the complex was observed during the short time scale of the SEC-MALS experiment. That Lsm11 interacts with a FLASH dimer is also consistent with the data from H/D exchange experiments. While the region between amino acids 100-120 showed the slowest H/ D exchange within the entire FLASH NTD (which we show here can form a dimer), this region underwent slower H/D exchange in the presence of Lsm11 and the reduced rate of exchange extended to amino acid 130 in FLASH [33] . Since H/D exchange occurs when hydrogen bonds are temporarily destabilized, this region of FLASH (residues 100-130) is in a more stable structure in the heterotrimer than in the homodimer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
