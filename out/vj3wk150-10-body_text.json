The cytosolic domain of ATF6 is then released and transported into the nucleus [10] , where it induces the expression of UPR genes, such as some ER protein chaperones (calreticulin, glucose regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) and GRP94), some ERAD proteins, as well as ER-resident enzymes (protein disulfide isomerase) [11] . With the help of several feedback mechanisms, the three UPR pathways mentioned above actually constitute an inter-related signaling network [1] . For example, XBP1 mRNA from the IRE1 branch has been shown to be induced by PERK and ATF6 when cells are under ER stress [6, 12] . Moreover, both PERK and PKR could be inhibited by P58 IPK , which is a downstream gene transcriptionally induced by XBP1s [13, 14] . Finally, the expression and activation of ATF6 could be enhanced by PERK, while ATF6 may induce protein disulfide isomerase A6, which promotes the degradation of IRE1 [15] [16] [17] . Hence, the three branches of UPR should be recognized as a closely interrelated and intricately regulated signaling network.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
