As with other viral RdRPs, the core polymerase adopts a shape analogous to a cupped right hand, with thumb and fingers rising on sides of the palm. The palm domain is the most conserved part of viral RdRPs, containing two catalytic aspartic acid residues (D536 of motif A and D668 of motif C in JEV NS5) that are absolutely conserved in all single-subunit processive polymerases [12] . The thumb domain of viral RdRP is relatively diverse. In ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
