Contact and saliva are the main modes of transmission although faeces have also been shown to contain virus shed from infected cats [3] . Cats exposed to FeLV may become either persistently viraemic or recover from the infection, with young cats being more rapidly infected following contact exposure [4] . A third category of cats infected with FeLV are those with a latent infection; they are not viraemic, but have a covert infection and do not develop FeLV disease [5] . Viraemic animals do not respond to FeLV antigens and show limited response to the virus, and are as a result at higher risk of developing fatal disease. Those cats which do recover from the infection produce virus neutralising antibodies which are considered important in preventing re-infection and can be passed through colostrum to protect neonatal kittens [6] . Antibodies to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) can also be induced, which protect against the development of FeLV-related neoplastic disease [7] . In addition to antibody-mediated responses the role of cell-mediated immune responses may also be involved with protection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
