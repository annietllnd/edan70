Purification and library construction methods have been established for RNA viruses at the extracellular stage (7, 10, 40) . However, the viral read ratio of intracellular RNA viruses (RNA viruses at the intracellular stage) in the RNA-seq library is typically < 1% because mRNA and rRNA are dominant in the total RNA fraction extracted from biological samples (25) . Therefore, the enrichment of viral RNA is essential for maximizing sensitivity in the identification of novel viruses. The physical enrichment of viral particles and nuclease digestion of non-viral nucleotides has been employed to increase the viral read ratio; however, a relatively low abundance of viral reads is still observed in most studies (39) . These techniques are only applicable to specific RNA viruses because not all RNA viruses form viral particles (21) . In addition, difficulties are associated with capturing terminal RNA sequences in an efficient and effective manner (32) and obtaining uniform coverage using the RNA-seq method. Sample preparation methods for effective viral RNA-seq are still inadequate and the sequence information generated is biased and incomplete.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
