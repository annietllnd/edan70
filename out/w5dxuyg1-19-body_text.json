As no statistically significant difference was found between these subgroups, all of Group 1.1 was compared to Group 1.2. Both Group 1.1a and 1.1b were also compared separately to Group 1.2. Within Group 1.1, cytokine mRNA levels from cats with and without effusions were compared. Each disease form subgroup of FIP cats was then compared with control cats. Where clinical information regarding the presence of effusions was lacking, the individuals were excluded from these comparisons. The IL-12p40:IL-10 mRNA ratio was evaluated using the Independent Samples Median Test.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
