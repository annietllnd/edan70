Although flavonols are known to have several hydroxyl groups, thought to have remarkable potential for binding any protein, the strength of the flavonols' inhibitory effect (IC 50 ) on dihydropyrimidinase was not correlated with the number of hydroxyl substituents on the flavonols' aromatic rings. In addition, the inhibitory effect (IC 50 ) of flavonols on dihydropyrimidinase was substrate-dependent. For example, as shown in Fig 3, the inhibitory effect of kaempferol on the activity of dihydropyrimidinase was significant only with dihydrouracil as a substrate (with IC 50 value of 50 ± 2 μM), but not with 5-propyl-hydantoin. Although our docking results (Fig 5) and the findings of the kinetic studies (Fig 6) both showed a competitive inhibition of the flavonol dihydromyricetin on dihydropyrimidinase, further structure-inhibition relationship studies are still needed for deeper understanding of and myricetin with dihydropyrimidinase. An aliquot amount of dihydromyricetin and myricetin was individually added to the enzyme solution for each K d . The Inhibition of Dihydropyrimidinase by Flavonoids the inhibition mechanism, particularly because we are still unsure whether each enzyme only contains a single dihydromyricetin within the active site of dihydropyrimidinase.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
