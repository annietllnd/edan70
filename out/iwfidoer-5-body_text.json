The improved method, named FLDS (fragmented and loop primer ligated dsRNA sequencing), was applied to a diatom colony in a tide pool and revealed previously unidentified RNA viruses. Our results indicate that the diversity of environmental RNA viruses has been underestimated due to the technical limitations in identifying entire RNA viromes in cellular organisms, and this technique will be a powerful tool for cataloging RNA viruses associated with organisms of interest.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
