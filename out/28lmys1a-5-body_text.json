For example, the average total cost to raise replacement heifers to wean was found to only increase by $82.88 per heifer from 2000 to 2015 but ranges within each study can exceed $350 per heifer [4] [5] [6] . Heinrichs [6] found a range in feed cost on 44 farms of $29.06 to $259.17 per calf; total cost per calf ranged $89.00-$442.78 during the pre-weaning period. In a 2014 survey of 2545 heifer calves in the United States, individual housing was the dominant form of housing pre-weaned heifers at 86.6% and 13.4% were managed in group housing, yet 8 different housing types were reported [7] . Little research has examined the cost between housing types, although the University of Wisconsin has conducted surveys of producers in an automatic and conventional housing scenario. The average cost (min, max) of producers utilizing individual housing was $363.69 ($195 .06, $530.76) and those with group housing was $401.58 ($138.39, $585.52), a difference in average cost of $37.89 per calf, but with a difference range of over $300 for individual and $400 for group housing [8] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
