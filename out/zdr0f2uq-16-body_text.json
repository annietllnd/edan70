Iminosugars, such as N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), inhibit ER Î±-glucosidase activity, resulting in the generation of unfolded, non-functional viral glycoproteins (Fig. 1B) . The antiviral activity of iminosugars has been tested on a diverse spectrum of viruses including HIV-1 [83] [84] [85] , influenza viruses [86, 87] , Ebola virus [88] , arenaviruses [89] , and flaviviruses [90] [91] [92] . A variety of iminosugar compounds have been shown to potently inhibit the release of infectious virion particles and the number of infected cells [93] . The inhibition of Dengue pathogeny by these compounds demonstrates the importance of glycosylation in Dengue glycoprotein folding and virulence. Despite these promising antiviral properties, iminosugars have yet to be clinically approved for antiviral indications. One barrier to their clinical application at the concentrations required to treat viral infections, such as HIV-1, appears to be the off-target effects of the drug which impede host gut glucosidases leading to diarrhoea and abdominal pains [85] . However, further derivatives are being investigated that may increase anti-viral specificity [94] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
