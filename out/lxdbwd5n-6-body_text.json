Some scholars examined their distribution characteristics in rat tissue and found that the concentrations of -GA in the liver and duodenum were significantly higher than those of -GA after i.v. administration. However, the concentrations of -GA in the other tissues were lower than or similar to those of -GA and declined rapidly. This indicates that the protective and antiinflammatory effects of -GA on the liver may be better than those of -GA [20] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
