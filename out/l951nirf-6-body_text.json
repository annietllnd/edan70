However, the AcHERV-HA vaccine only elicited an immune response to HA proteins. Such monovalency may limit the degree of protection against heterologous influenza viruses [21] . Here, we constructed a baculovirus carrying pH1N1 HA, NA, and M1 genes that is able to assemble VLPs in mammalian cells. The efficacy of the VLP-forming baculovirus vaccine-AcHERV-VLP-was tested in BALB/c mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
