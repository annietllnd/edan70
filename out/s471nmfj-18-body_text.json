To further investigate whether VP1 disturbs cell cycle, HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-VP1 for 24 h, and cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry. Control cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1. As shown in Figure 1 , EGFP was evenly distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the control cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 ( Figure 1A , upper panel). VP1 was localized in both cytoplasm and the nucleus, while the accumulation of VP1 in the nucleus was obvious (lower panel of Figures 1A,B) . Cell population at G1 phase was significantly increased in the cells expressing VP1 (Figures 1D-F) , indicating that VP1, the structural component of CVB3, disturbs the progression of cell cycle.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
