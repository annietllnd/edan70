I. pacificus ticks are also vectors for several other vectorborne pathogens including Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, I. pacificus ticks have been shown to carry Spiroplasma ixodetis [3] , a microorganism that has no known role in human disease. Broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) can detect multiple pathogens in a single test including tick-borne pathogens [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . PCR/ESI-MS can also detect novel and uncharacterized organisms [10, 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . We have previously used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize a large collection of ticks, including I. pacificus ticks from California, for the prevalence of B. miyamotoi [6] . Most studies of I. pacificus ticks have employed tests designed to detect single pathogens and not co-infections. In this study we used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize the breadth of microorganisms carried by I. pacificus collected from throughout the state of California. In the ticks analyzed, we detected several previously described endemic zoonotic pathogens as well as Babesia odocoilei, a protozoan not previously known to be carried by I. pacificus. Many of the microbes carried by ticks are obligate intracellular microbes and have not been cultured but have been identified and characterized genetically such as 'Candidatus Rickettsia andeanae', 'Candidatus Rickettsia vini' and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' [20] [21] [22] [23] . In our study we identified and genetically characterized a novel and widespread Anaplasmataceae species which is genetically most closely related to isolates from Asia.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
