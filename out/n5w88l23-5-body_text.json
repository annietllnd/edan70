The increased prevalence of beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria has begun to reduce the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams against the most common opportunistic pathogen [16] . To date, over 800 beta-lactamases have been identified, of which at least 120 beta-lactamases have been detected in P. aeruginosa [17] . The development of clinically useful small-molecule antibiotics and identification of new targets in microorganisms are seminal events in the field of infectious diseases [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
