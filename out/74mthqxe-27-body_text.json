It has been repeatedly shown that hemifusion is promoted by negative spontaneous curvature and is inhibited by positive spontaneous curvature [51, 57] . Consequently, if IFITM proteins conferred positive spontaneous curvature to membranes that contain them, these proteins would naturally block hemifusion. As OA has a large negative spontaneous curvature [57] , we reasoned that it should overcome the inhibitory actions of IFITM proteins if the curvature was at the core of the action of IFITMs. Experimentally, we observed that the addition of OA virtually overcame all of the block of fusion by IFITM proteins (Figs. 7A and B) . That is, when hemifusion was induced by the addition of OA, pore formation readily resulted without any inhibition despite the expression of IFITM proteins in the target membrane. The fact that the addition of OA after establishing CAS had no apparent effect on IFITMmediated inhibition further supports the conclusion that the block occurs at steps prior to the creation of hemifusion (Figs. 7A and B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
