This suggests that many important pseudoknots fold up in a hierarchical fashion like most secondary structure. The primary difference is that the pseudoknot will form somewhat concomitant with the progressive folding of secondary structure on time scales observable using NMR spectroscopy. Cooperative folding may reflect the time scale of the measurement and the sequence lengths more than the process in these examples. The approach used in vsfold5 is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] and adds further weight to its importance in RNA folding. It is also consistent with contact order models [26] [27] [28] in that longer sequence lengths take longer to fold.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
