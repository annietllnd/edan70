Next, cells were treated with a mouse anti-pH1N1 primary antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 hours, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,). Images of immune-stained cells were obtained using an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-U; Nikon, Japan).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
