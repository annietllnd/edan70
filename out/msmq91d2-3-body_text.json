The Ssegment encodes N and NSs genes in an ambi-sense manner, the M-segment contains a single open reading frame (ORF) which encodes NSm, 78-kD protein, NSm-Gn, Gn, and Gc proteins from different AUGs and co-translational cleavage; and the Lsegment encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [19, 20, 21, 22] . The nonstructural protein, NSs is a major virulence factor, and it inhibits host general transcription by inhibiting host basal transcription factor (TF) IIH; TFIIH is one of six general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) [23] , composed of 10 different proteins; i.e., XPD, XPB, p8, p34, p44, p52, p62, MAT1, cyclin H and cdk7 [24, 25] , and essential for RNA synthesis by cellular RNA polymerase I and II [26, 27] . NSs binds to and sequester TFIIH p44 [28] and also promotes the degradation of TFIIH p62 [29] . On the other hand, NSs inhibits the activation of interferon (IFN)-b promoter by interacting with Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) and recruiting repressor complex containing histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC-3) [30, 31] , while NSs promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR [32, 33, 34] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
