This interaction leads to the Akt-dependent inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins on the one hand and the activation of NFkÎ²-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes on the other [71, 72] . An association of these two survival pathways has been known for a long time [73] and Bagchi and coworkers suggest these to be partially overlapping or even cooperative in case of rotavirus infection [71] . Dengue virus and japanese encephalitis virus, both members of the single-stranded RNA flavivirus family, also make use of a PI3K-dependent blocking of apoptosis as early as 15 min after infection, indicating that the mere viral attachment leads to an activation of the signaling pathway [74] . However, treatment of infected cells with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or Wortmannin did not alter effective viral replication. Nonetheless the PI3K/Akt signaling appears to protect the infected cells from early apoptosis and thereby offers more time to generate virus progeny.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
