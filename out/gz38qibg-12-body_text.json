The proportion of total 'up' S1 RBD conformations within the ACE2-bound and -unbound classes is nearly identical within this dataset (58% 'up' S1 RBD). This strongly suggests that binding of a single ACE2 receptor does not induce adjacent S1 RBDs to transition from a 'down' to 'up' conformation within the context of the stabilized S. Hence, ACE2 is more likely to bind to an already 'up' S1 RBD rather than inducing the conformational changes that are required for the S1 RBD to become accessible to ACE2. Though the proportion of 'up' S1 RBD in the ACE2 dataset (58%) is similar to the proportion of 'up' S1 RBD in the SARS S 2P ectodomain dataset (48%), there is a large difference in the distributions of one 'up' and two 'up' conformational states between these datasets. The significance of this difference remains unclear.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
