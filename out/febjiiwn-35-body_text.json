Arthropod pathogen microarray (APM) analysis of test samples revealed that combined analysis of 5 bees reproducibly detected most, if not all, of the pathogens detected from 10 or 15 independently analyzed bees from the same sample. In addition, we confirmed the consistency of APM results by performing multiple analyses of a single RNA sample. Based on our test results and practical sample handling considerations, we reasoned that repeated analysis of 5 bees from each colony over-time (115 bees per colony) was sufficient for this study.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
