All three PBM mutants were viable, showing that the consequences of the presence of E and 3a protein PBMs when these proteins have been completely deleted are different from those seen when only their PBM is missing. However, virus titers decreased 10-fold when both viral PBMs were missing in comparison to the levels seen with the parental virus or mutants lacking only one PBM (Fig. 11A) . Remarkably, when PBM was present in E protein, the virus was highly virulent independently of whether the 3a protein included a PBM (Fig. 11B) . In contrast, mortality significantly decreased when E protein lacked a PBM, regardless of the presence or absence of a PBM within protein 3a. These results indicated that the impact of the presence or absence of the E protein PBM on virulence is definitive, as it determines whether a virus is pathogenic or nonpathogenic, respectively. In contrast, the presence or absence of 3a protein with or without its PBM had little impact on virus virulence, illustrating the much greater relevance of the E protein PBM than of the 3a PBM with respect to virus pathogenicity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
