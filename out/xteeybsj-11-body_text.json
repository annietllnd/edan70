A seroprevalence study of a farm in São Paulo found a prevalence of 85Á3% for both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses; 11 however, rates of 2Á2% and 16Á3%, respectively, were found for the same viruses in a study of several Brazilian states. 10 In another study, a prevalence of 20Á1% was reported for the H3N2 virus in a herd in Paran a state. 13 Although the prevalences in these Brazilian studies were related to human viruses, our rates were not similar. In 2009, a seroprevalence study investigated the prevalence of anti-swine influenza virus antibodies in sows from 17 farrow-to-finish farms in Minas Gerais state and found rates of 44Á5% and 10Á1% for swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, respectively. 12 In this case, although the prevalence was higher than that found in our study, it aligns more closely than those found in other Brazilian states. In contrast, a higher prevalence of antibodies against H3N2 virus was found in a herd from southern Brazil, 13 suggesting that there may be differences in the circulating serotypes of influenza virus in different regions of Brazil.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
