Cells were washed with cold PBS twice and fixed with cold 75% ethanol for 1 h or overnight at 4 • C. Cells were suspended with 500 µl of cold PBS, followed by the addition of 20 µl RNase A solution (BestBio, Shanghai, China) and incubation at 37 • C for 30 min. Cells were stained with 70 µM propidium iodide (BestBio) in the PBS containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 at dark for 1 h. Cellular DNA content was quantified by a flow cytometer LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were obtained based on 30,000 events collected by flow cytometry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
