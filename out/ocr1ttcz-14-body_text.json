At 1 week post-inoculation, most (3 or 4 out of 5) mice inoculated with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E truncation mutants had high levels of serum IgG against ZIKV E protein. At week 2 postinoculation, all mice in these groups had developed IgG Ab. Ab titers further increased and remained at a high level through week 5. In contrast, none of the mice vaccinated with rVSV expressing E/E truncation mutants without prM had detectable ZIKVspecific antibody by week 1. The same was true for rVSV-prM-E-NS1. At week 2, Ab was observed in these groups and increased through week 5. However, the Ab titers in these groups were significantly lower than those of the viruses co-expressing prM-E/ E truncation mutants (P < 0.05, t-test). Ab was not detectable in the DNA vaccine group until week 5, despite the fact that these mice had been given two doses (at week 0 and 2). The Ab detected in the DNA vaccine group at week 5 post-immunization was also lower than that induced by the rVSV-prM-E/E truncations. These results demonstrate that a single-dose inoculation of mice with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E truncations triggered high levels of serum antibody response as early as 1-2 weeks post-inoculation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
