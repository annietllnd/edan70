Using densitometry to assess relative band intensities does not provide indel % (and thus does not reflect editing efficiency in a linear and informative manner), yet this is what seems to have been done according to the materials/methods section. Furthermore, the precursor report (Del'Guidice et al. 2018) seems to have committed the same error. Instead, it is appropriate to use the equation 100 x (1-(1-(b+c) / (a+b+c))^(1/2), where a is the intensity of undigested PCR product, and b and c are the intensities of the cleaved products (see Guschin et al. (2010) in Engineered Zinc Finger Proteins. It seems that this might only apply to the data in Figure  1b , but it is a crucial distinction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
