AdV type 5 induces the disruption of endosomal membranes and the release of cathepsin B, thereby activating NLRP3 (28, 45) . This activation is required for the lysosomal localization and membrane penetration ability of AdV, since the temperature-sensitive mutant of Ad5 cannot induce the activation of NLRP3. ROS are also required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation since lower levels of IL-1Î² were observed in the presence of NADPH oxidase inhibitors or the oxygen scavenger N-acetylcysteine. IAV infection, or RNA species, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing lysosomal acidification (5) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
