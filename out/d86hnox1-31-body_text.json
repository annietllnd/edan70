This could be of technological interest, for example to produce a very compact plasmid or to prevent the fixation of mutations and genetic drift in a plasmid or a synthetic organism. Given the surprising ease with which a dual gene can be designed, we also considered and verified the possibility of creating 200 triple genes that use not two, but three of the six possible overlapping reading frames. With additional effort, other triple genes with even better E-values could be obtained. This could be a way to reduce genetic drift even more drastically, constraining an artifical organism to stay close to its original genotype.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
