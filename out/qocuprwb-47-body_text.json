However, levels of IL-2 and IL-4 in the brains were not increased when WT and TNF-α KO groups at 5 and or 7 days pi were compared ( Figure 7C ). Moreover, levels of perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL were not increased in TNF-α KO when compared with WT mice at 7 days pi. However, histopathological data showed that TNF-α KO mice presented with severe acute necrotic changes in the brain cortex compared which was not the case for WT and IL-10 KO mice at 9 days pi ( Figure 7D ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
