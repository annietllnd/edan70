To do so, we searched the Protein Data Bank for the structures of proteins from cellular organisms similar to the viral proteins from each considered functional class. We have been able to identify several folds observed exclusively in viruses and others with structural homologs in cellular species. The virus-specific folds identified here complete the list of the hallmark viral proteins [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
