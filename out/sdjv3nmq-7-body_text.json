Also, to determine the functional domain required, several MKK7 mutants were generated. ATP-binding site (K149) was mutated in the KM mutant. Residues phosphorylated by MKKKs (S271, T275, and S277) were mutated to glutamates in the 3E mutant, which served as a "phosphomimetic" of active MKK7. In the 3A mutant, the same three residues were mutated to alanines, rendering it resistant to phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Transfected H1299 cells were irradiated with UVC, a condition known to activate JNK pathway. UVC-induced moderate JNK phosphorylation in vector control (Fig. 3a) . Wild-type MKK7-enhanced UVCinduced JNK phosphorylation by~2.2-fold. Phos-JNK in MKK7-KM-transfected cells was slightly lower than vector control, so it might serve as a dominant negative mutant that inhibited activation of endogenous MKK7.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
