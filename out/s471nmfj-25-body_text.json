In the cells infected with CVB3, Hsp70, and p27 Kip1 were markedly increased, while cyclin E was decreased ( Figures 6A,B) . These data show that the dysregulated Hsp70, cyclin E, and p27 Kip1 contribute to G1 arrest induced by CVB3 infection. These data also imply that VP1 at least contributes to G1 arrest during CVB3 infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
