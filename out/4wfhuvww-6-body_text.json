Alternative splicing may contribute to frameshifting (Hiller et al., 2005) , as can codon bias. For instance, rare tRNA codons can favor −1 and +1 frameshifting (Gurvich et al., 2005; Laine et al., 2008) , and rare arginine codons prime mitochondrial sequences for frameshifting (Temperley et al., 2010) . Moreover, CAG repeats are prone to frameshifting, which results in poly-alanine proteins that may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Toulouse et al., 2005) . The use of the peptidyltransferase inhibitor anisomycin reduces −1 frameshifting in these cases and reduces the toxicity associated with the expanded triplet repeats. Importantly, out-of-frame proteins (compared to the standard ORFeome annotation) can also result from alternative AUG or CUG start sites (Ingolia et al., 2011) , thereby considerably increasing the size of an alternative "frameshifted" proteome. Main sources of out-of-frame peptides and proteins are shown in Figure 2 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
