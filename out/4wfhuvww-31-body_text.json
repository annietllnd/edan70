This can be accomplished by gene targeting with a gene sequence that harbours multiple wobble base pair mutations or mutating the frameshift motif, thus altering the RNA sequence but not the in-frame protein sequence. This is technically challenging and may not always be feasible. For instance, an OAZ3 knockout mouse model has been generated, where both the zero frame and the +1 frame has been deleted (Tokuhiro et al., 2009) . To my knowledge, no specific gene targeting of a frameshift protein has been done so far.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
