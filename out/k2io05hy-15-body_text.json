Seg-9 was cut from the gel using a clean scalpel blade, purified using RNaid kit (MP Biomedicals) and cDNA was synthesised using a single primer amplification technique as previously described [19] ). The ORFs in Seg-9 from BTV-8 (between nucleotides 182 and 415, accession number: AM498059) and GIV (between nucleotides 176 and 748: accession number HM543473) were PCR amplified using specific primers tailed with restriction enzyme sites shown in table 1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
