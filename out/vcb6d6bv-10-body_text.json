When this happens the protein will insert into the membrane after translation is completed (i.e., post-translationally). Post-translational targeting into the ER membrane uses cytosolic molecular chaperones [29, 30] that prevent protein misfolding and keeps the newly synthesized in a translocation/insertion competent state until they reach the ER membrane. Surprisingly, the mammalian cytochrome b5 can enter the ER membrane unassisted [31] , demonstrating the possibility of an alternative machinery-free insertion mechanism.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
