All mRNAs contain a common 5′-leader sequence (65-90 nucleotides long) and a co-terminal 3′-end [78] . The 5′-leader sequence binds to N protein and form a complex, may act as a strong translation initiation signal and promote viral mRNA translation [79, 80] . For each mRNA, only the 5′-open reading frames (ORFs) are translated via cap-dependent manner. Most of the mRNAs are monocistronic, while some mRNAs are bicistronic or tricistronic. mRNA1 encodes two large precursor polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, pp1ab is translated via −1 programmed ribosomal shifting manner. Both polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically cleaved by virus encoded proteases, papain-like proteinase (PL pro ) and 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ), into 13-16 mature non-structural proteins (nsps). Many of the nsps participate in viral RNA replication and transcription. The subgenomic mRNAs are translated into structural proteins haemagglutinin-esterase (HE), spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), and several nsps, respectively. HE is only encoded by β coronavirus. The expression ratio of these genes is regulated at the level of transcription, during which time the shorter mRNAs are produced more abundantly than the longer one [81, 82] . The 5′-UTR (untranslated region), which is unique for each of mRNA, also regulate the rate of each mRNA translation [83] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
