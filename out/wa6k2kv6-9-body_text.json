Data collected included demography, clinical observations (such as symptoms, chronic medical conditions, treatment, temperature) and laboratory test results. For RT-PCRpositive patients, we additionally used telephone interviews to determine treatment, co-morbidity, vaccination status and duration of fever. All variables and analyzed data are shown in Table 1 . A single throat swab, using Sterile Rayon Swabs( 167KS01), was collected from each ILI-patient who had not received antiviral drugs. The swab was immediately placed in virus transport media tubes. Each sample was frozen within 24 hours at 270uC until analyzed. In total, 279 clinical specimens were analyzed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
