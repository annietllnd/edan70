The IC 50 values of dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, and acetohydroxamate were around 30, 50, and 500 mM, respectively. The IC 50 values of these substrate and inhibitor analogs of other cyclic amidases for dihydropyrimidinase were within the millimolar range.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
