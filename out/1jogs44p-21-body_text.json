In support of this observation, phylogenetic trees built with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods indicated that five of the eight zebrafish CEACAMs on chromosome 16 (DreCEACAMI-V) form a sub-branch in which no homologs from other species are present, indicating that lineage-specific expansion could account for the large number of CEACAM homologs found in select fish species (Figs. 2c and 3c ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
