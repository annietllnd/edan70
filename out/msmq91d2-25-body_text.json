To understand the functional difference between RVFV NSs and other phlebovirus NSs, we first tested whether they degraded PKR. To avoid the up-regulation of PKR by type-I IFN, we used type-I IFN-incompetent VeroE6 cells [59, 60] . VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12, rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs at a m.o.i of 3 and cells were collected at 16 hpi for Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A) . As expected, cells infected with MP-12 promoted the degradation of PKR, while cells infected with MP-12 encoding NSs of PTV or SFSV expressed abundant PKR at 16 hpi. The NSs accumulation of rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs could not be detected by mouse polyclonal antibodies against PTV or SFSV probably due to the sensitivity of the antibody to detect NSs (data not shown). To evaluate the level of each NSs accumulation, NSs of PTV or SFSV were fused to Flag-tag at the C-terminus, and the resulting viruses were designated as rMP12-PTNSs-Flag or rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag, respectively. As a control for NSs-Flag expression, we also used rMP12-NSs-Flag, which encodes an MP-12 NSs with a C-terminus Flag-tag [32] . VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag, rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs-Flag or rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag at a m.o.i of 3, collected at 16 hpi, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B , we confirmed that NSs of PTV Adames and SFSV were expressed at 16 hpi. Collectively, we concluded that the rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs do not promote the degradation of PKR.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
