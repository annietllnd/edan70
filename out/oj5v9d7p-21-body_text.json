Furthermore, HSF-deficient cells were also characterised by a dramatic reduction in HSP90Î± expression under normal growth conditions. There is a tissue specificity in HSF expression. For example, upon severe heat shock, HSF1 was shown to mediate transcriptional activity only in the brain. At the same time, HSF3 was found to be exclusively activated in blood cells as a result of heat treatment following induction of heat-shock genes [125] . It has been demonstrated that vertebrate HSF2 can be induced in the physiological range of temperature. In fact, HSF2 deficiency was found to reduce the threshold for chicken HSF3 activation, and HSF2-null cells became more susceptible to mild heat shock in comparison to wild-type cells. In addition, HSF2-deficient cells were characterised by the accumulation of ubiquitylated misfolded proteins [126] . In general, the vital roles of HSFs in the adaptation of poultry to commercially relevant stress conditions are proven. Recent genome-wide studies have provided information to appreciate the roles of HSF1 in reprogramming transcription not only in stress conditions but also in physiological conditions [127] . Detailed analysis of possible protective functions and regulation of HSP70 and HO-1 in avian species has been recently published [111] [112] [113] and can be summarised as follows.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
