The sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a double-sector epon charcoal-filled centerpiece at 20˚C with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. Protein solutions of 0.05 to 1 mg/ml (330 μl) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT (low-salt condition) and reference (370 μl) solutions were loaded into the centerpiece, respectively. The absorbance at 280 nm was monitored in a continuous model with a time interval of 300 s and a step size of 0.003 cm. Multiple scans at different time intervals were then fitted to a continuous c(s) distribution model using the SEDFIT program [57] . Additionally, the results with the various different protein concentrations were globally fitted to monomer-dimer self-association or A + B <-> AB hetero-association model using the SEDPHAT program to calculate the dissociation constant (K d ) [58] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
