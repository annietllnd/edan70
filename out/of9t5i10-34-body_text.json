The IL-1R signalling pathway, stimulated by poly (ICLC) is implicated in increased plasma IL-6 concentrations. Male rats given IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1ra) prior to poly (IC) administration had elevated plasma TNF-, but not IL-6, concentrations and a reduction of fever [139] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
