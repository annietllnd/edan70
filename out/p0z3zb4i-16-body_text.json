In order to estimate the degree of immunosuppressive strength in the patient population, an arbitrary score ranging form 0-4 was applied (see methods). Abbreviations: BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage, FOB = fiberoptic bronchoscopy, PNA = pneumonia/pneumonitis, ys = years. Abbreviations used are: acyclo = acyclovir, Ag = antigen, amphoB = amphotericin B, ARDS = adult respiratory distress syndrome, Aza = azathioprine, BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage, ceftaz = ceftazidime, ceftriax = ceftriaxone, cipro = ciprofloxacin, clari = clarithromycin, CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure, CT = computed tomography, coag neg = coagulase negative, cyclo = cyclophosphamide, d = day, ery = erythromycin, fluc = fluconazole, genta = gentamycin, Geq/ml = genome equivalents/ml; HHT = hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome), INH = isoniazid, Lefl = leflunomide, linez = linezolid, mero = meropenem, metro = metronidazole, moxi = moxifloxacin, MTX = methotrexate, Pred = prednisone, tazo = piperacillin/tazobactam, tobra = tobramycin, vanco = vancomycin, w = week. *testing was seasonal during winter only. **testing was at the discretion of the physician performing bronchoscopy. In the present study of 63 patients with autoimmune disease and pneumonia/pneumontis, no offending agent could be found in 60% of cases. In the remaining 40% a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi and viruses was identified ( Figure 3A ). Of note, one case of pneumonitis was due to methotrexate. Two cases (3.2%) were most likely due to HSV-1, while HSV-1 was a bystander of other agents in the remaining four cases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
