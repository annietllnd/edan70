Figure 4 shows the amino acid composition of a small group of class I and II viroporins TM segments (data obtained from sequences presented in Figures 1 and 2 ) compared to TM helices from membrane protein structures (data from [18] ). This unusual number of Leu and Ile residues could be a consequence of their membrane architecture. In class I viroporins the single TM domain must be able to direct and anchor the protein to the membrane by itself. No interactions with other TM segments that could facilitate the insertion are possible at this point. Therefore, class I TM domains must be hydrophobic enough (higher percentage of highly hydrophobic residues) to fulfill the process successfully. Furthermore, regardless of the protein sequence the formation of a functional water-filled channel from monomeric helical subunits requires some amphipatic distribution. Consequently, in order to achieve quaternary structures an energy penalty step should be overcomed, either at stage I or at stage II of the insertion/folding process. Either polar residues that will end up facing the aqueous environment once the channel is formed must be inserted in the non polar membrane (stage I), or a hydrophobic surface is exposed to the water rich channel interior once the monomers create the water filled channel (stage II). In any case, this energy penalty must be compensated by other forces. Probably, by the favorable insertion of an elevated number of highly hydrophobic side chains (Leu and Ile) facing the lipids [63] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
