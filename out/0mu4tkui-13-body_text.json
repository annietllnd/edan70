The enrichment index was calculated by dividing the percentage of viral sequences in the captured sample by the percentage viral sequences in the input sample. A value above 1 indicates antibody capture of the virus, which suggests a immunogenic course of infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
