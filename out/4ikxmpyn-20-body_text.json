The process of viral replication causes lytic cell death and subsequent potassium efflux, which provides the second signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (62) . The PB1-F2 protein from IAV induces oxidative stress and the alteration of mitochondrial calcium, leading to apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation (63) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
