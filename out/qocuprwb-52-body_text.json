However, it is important to note that the levels of inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α KO mice and the resultant mortality were dramatically higher than those observed in IL-10 KO mice. IL-10 has an immunoregulatory function on various cells in the innate immune system including cytotoxic and helper T cells, NK cells and B cells [59] . IL-10 signaling has a negative role in immunity against WNV infection [45] . It is also known that TNF-α is a critical regulatory cytokine exerting homeostatic and pathological effects in the CSF [60] . Therefore, our data imply that TNF-α mediates greater efficacy of immunoregulatory function during JEV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
