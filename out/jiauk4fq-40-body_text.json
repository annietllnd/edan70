In this respect, further research is required into the possible involvement of this concomitance, through the use of live BVDV and BHV-1 vaccines, in the triggering of an impaired pulmonary immune response. On the contrary, animals pre-inoculated with BVDVdespite suffering a transient infection -exhibit an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines which play a key role in activating the immune response.
