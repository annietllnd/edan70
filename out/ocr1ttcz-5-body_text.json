VSV is a natural pathogen of livestock such as cattle and swine, as such, there is no pre-existing immunity against VSV in the human population 35, 36 . VSV is an excellent platform for vaccine development. VSV can accommodate multiple foreign genes, and thus can be developed into a multivalent vaccine 35, 36 . Antigens are highly expressed in both cell culture and animals by VSV, enabling the generation of strong systemic immune responses 35, 37 . In response to the sudden outbreaks of Ebola virus in Africa in 2013, a VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was tested in human clinical trials [38] [39] [40] [41] . In general, VSV is safe in humans although high doses of VSV can cause side effects in some people including joint and muscle pain [39] [40] [41] . Importantly, the VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was shown to be highly efficacious in protecting against Ebola virus infection in humans [39] [40] [41] . During preparation of this manuscript, Betancourt et al., reported that maternal antibody derived from female C57BL/6 mice inoculated with VSV expressing prM-E can protect offspring from lethal ZIKV infection 42 . However, whether an immunized animal can be protected against ZIKV infection is not known.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
