In contrast, the literary evidence did not provide a clear benefit of eating fresh fruits in preventing cariogenesis [62, 63] . However, certain fruit extracts (e.g., Morinda citrifolia) have been associated with inhibiting the growth of cariogenic bacteria [64] , indicating the need to further evaluate the relevance of fresh fruit consumption to dental caries experience. In general, our findings were consistent with studies that linked intake of foods with high sugar content and dental caries in Saudi Arabia [19, 65] and other places [58] [59] [60] 66] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
