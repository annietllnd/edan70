[9] [10] As far as we are aware, there are no confirmed examples of anthroponosis, i.e., transmission of arboviruses from humans to animals. 9-10 The term arbovirus is not a taxonomic indicator; it describes their requirement for a vector in their transmission cycle. [11] [12] Humans and animals infected by arboviruses, may suffer diseases ranging from sub-clinical or mild through febrile to encephalitic or hemorrhagic with a significant proportion of fatalities. In contrast, arthropods infected by arboviruses do not show detectable signs of sickness, even though the virus may remain in the arthropod for life. As of 1992, 535 species belonging to 14 virus families were registered in the International Catalogue of Arboviruses. 12 However, this estimate is continuously increasing as advances in virus isolation procedures and sequencing methods impact on virus studies. Whilst many current arboviruses do not appear to be human or animal pathogens, this large number of widely different and highly adaptable arboviruses provides an immense resource for the emergence of new pathogens in the future.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
