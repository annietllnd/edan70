Thus, it can be expected that certain codons may favour frameshifting. FSCAN is a program to identify +1 frameshift sequences based on codon usage in E. coli . FScan searches 16 nt sequences and calculates a score for aa-tRNA competition between the zero and +1 frame. Accordingly, a stop codon, or a rare codon in the zero frame can be a predictor of +1 frameshifting. Shah et al. suggested that selective pressure would lead to an under-representation of frameshift sites in protein-coding sequences relative to an organism's codon bias (Shah et al., 2002) . They predicted the sequences CUU AGG C and CUU AGU U, which mediate +1 frameshifting of ABP140 and EST3, respectively, to be highly under-represented and predictive for frameshifting in S. cerevisiae.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
