ZIKV-specific neutralizing Ab was determined using a microneutralization (MN) assay as described with modifications 17 . Briefly, serum samples were serially diluted twofold in 96-well micro-plates, and 100 μl of virus solution containing 50 PFU of ZIKV-Cambodian strain was added to 100 μl of each serum dilution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The mixtures were then transferred to 24-well plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers. After incubation for 60 h at 37°C, cells were fixed with 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. After permeation by 0.4% (vol/vol) Triton-X 100 at room temperature for 20 min and washed for three times, a ZIKV E monoclonal antibody (MyBioSource, Inc.) was added to each well at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated at 37°C for 2 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:2000 was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS for three times. The plates were then developed with 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate for 1 h at room temperature and stained plaques in each well were counted under light microscope. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of neutralizing antibody in mice serum was calculated based on the number of plaques in each well compared with the average value of DMEM group.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
