It has been proposed that viruses of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group have acquired many of their genes via HGT [21] . For example, many sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway genes are shared between the microalga Emiliania huxleyi and its large dsDNA virus EhV-86 [22] . However, the direction of the gene transfer is unknown in this case. Chordopoxvirinae, a subfamily of the Poxviridae family, have acquired many proteins from eukaryotes, which is evidenced by their higher similarity to the eukaryotic counterparts than to other viral proteins [23] . The Sputnik phage that infects Mimivirus has borrowed a large fraction of its proteins from its host, possibly the first virus-to-virus horizontal gene transfer event documented [24] . On the other hand, this is again an event of gene capture from the host, which in this case is, quite unusually, another virus.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
