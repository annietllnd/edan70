The purification of dsRNA was achieved by the repeated affinity purification of dsRNA using cellulose powder and the enzymatic removal of ssRNA and DNA. Purified dsRNAs were fragmented using ultrasound to retrieve all types of dsRNA viruses in order to apply the previously reported full-length dsRNA cloning method using a loop primer (8) . The full-length dsRNA cloning method requires overlapped cDNAs synthesized from both terminal ends for further cDNA amplification, and was only applicable to short dsRNA molecules. Reverse transcription was initiated from the ligated loop primer on both ends of the dsRNA fragment. cDNA was then thermally denatured to allow annealing of single-stranded cDNA with the complementary sequence in the 3â€² terminal region. The single-stranded regions of annealed cDNA were filled in with DNA polymerase. The doublestranded cDNA derived from dsRNA was amplified by PCR with a single primer (PC2) in order to obtain sufficient cDNA to construct a sequencing library.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
