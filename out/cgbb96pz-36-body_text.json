Cyclophilin-binding loop sequences can be found in S2 Fig and primers used in site-directed mutagenesis PCR are listed in S1 Table. Purification of virions to probe Gag maturation of capsid mutants was performed by layering 500 μl of filtered supernatant from virus-producing 293T cells onto 1 mL of 20% sucrose in PBS followed by centrifugation at 20,000xg for 90 minutes at 4˚C. Virus-containing pellets were resuspended in 40 μl 1X Laemmeli buffer and 10 μl was used for western blot analysis. Whole-cell extracts were also prepared at the same time to analyze intracellular Gag maturation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
