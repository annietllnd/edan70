Retroviruses require frameshifting for replication and infection (Maia et al., 1996; Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2006) . For example, the HIV1 polyprotein gag-pol requires efficient âˆ’1 frameshifting for expression of the individual gag and pol gene products. This form of frameshifting usually depends on a combination of a "slippery sequence," a spacer sequence of 1-15 nucleotides, and a stem-loop secondary RNA structure such as a pseudoknot (Figure 1 ) (Namy et al., 2006) . The slippery sequence is generally of the type X XXY YYZ, where X denotes any nucleotide, Y denotes A or U, and Z is A, U, or C. Pseudoknots are secondary RNA substructures that contain two or more stemloop motifs with intercalated stems. The pseudoknot or stemloop structure in the mRNA is thought to result in pausing of the ribosome, resulting in eventual frameshifting (Namy et al., 2006) . Structural evidence for this mechanism comes from the crystal structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) pseudoknot, which has an unpaired adenine that acts as a hinge to mediate frameshifting (Chen et al., 1996) . Generally, there is a correlation between the mechanical strength of an mRNA pseudoknot and its frameshifting efficiency (Hansen et al., 2007) : the stronger the pseudoknot the higher the frameshifting efficiency, although very strong pseudoknots can cause a road block that limits translation downstream (Tholstrup et al., 2011) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
