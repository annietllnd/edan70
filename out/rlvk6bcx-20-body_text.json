Yet, over the three decades since its discovery, it shows no sign of evolving lower virulence. The primary reason there is little selective pressure on Bd for virulence attenuation is that it can infect a very vast host range so that the extinction of any particular host species has limited impact on its fitness. Even worse, some host species, such as the widely introduced African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, and the American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, carry the disease asymptomatically, fuelling the global Bd pandemics and limiting any shortterm prospect for significant decrease in virulence [14] . These are just examples of the evolution of virulence but both illustrate that there is no simple pattern of decrease in pathogenicity with time.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
