Huh7 and Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing Calnexin or NS4B-HA replicon were obtained from Dr Ralf Bartenschlager. Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing the T7 polymerase (Huh7-Lunet-T7) was obtained from Dr. Volker Lohmann, and the Huh7.5 cell line was obtained from Dr. Charles Rice. All Huh7-derived cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Multicell), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μ g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , in a humidified incubator. Cell lines harboring the wild-type replicon or NS4B HA were maintained in medium supplemented with G418 (Gibco) at a final concentration of 500 μ g/ml. Huh7-Lunet-T7 and Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing calnexin were cultured in the presence of 10 μ g/ml blasticidin (In vivo Gen).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
