Other viral proteins, such as non-structural 2B proteins from EMCV, HRV, poliovirus and EV71, as well as N protein from SARS-CoV, cause the flux of calcium from intracellular storages to the cytosol, which is indispensable for NLRP3 activation (49) (50) (51) . The HCV core protein regulates intracellular calcium flux through a phospholipase C-dependent process, instead of directly changing the membrane permeability (52) . HRV infection also induces the co-localization of NLRP3 and NLRC5, which sense calcium fluxes and assemble in a cooperative manner (50) . Influenza virus M2, RSV small hydrophobic (SH) protein, and SARS-CoV viroporin 3a change membrane permeability by forming a cation-selective ion channel. As a result, the ion channel permits the release of Na + /K + , rather than Ca 2+ , to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (53) (54) (55) . The disturbance of ionic concentrations leads to mitochondria damage and the production of ROS, potentiating NLRP3 inflammasome activation (55) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
