However, once homeostasis is disrupted, the NLRP3 inflammasome will sense danger signals and activate accordingly. Potassium efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (46, 47) . HCV infection induces potassium efflux in macrophages, thus leading to the maturation of pro-IL-1Î² (21) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
