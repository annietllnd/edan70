As described earlier, we labeled cells with fluorescentlyconjugated anti-human Fc and anti-human IgG Kappa chain antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Only when cultures were treated with 0.5M DTT in the presence of 6M urea, did we observe a complete loss in the ability to detect the light chain on the surface of these cells (50% of Fc was still detectable due to the presence of cell wall-anchored Fc-Sed1p bait) ( Figure 2D ). We concluded that in this method, the capture of the half antibody (Hc+Lc) on the cell surface occurs via both hydrophobic and covalent interaction in a manner similar to the assembly of full length IgGs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
