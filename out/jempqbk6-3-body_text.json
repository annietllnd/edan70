The genome type can be either DNA or RNA, single-or double-stranded and, in the case of a single strand, positive-or negative-sense. Retroviruses are considered a separate group that includes DNA-and RNA-encoded viruses. Altogether, this results in seven top-level classes. Lower-level groups comprise viral orders, families, sub-families, genera and species. Viruses with certain types of genome-encoding nucleic acid have been traditionally associated with different domains of life: Archaea and Bacteria usually harbor viruses with a DNA genome, whereas eukaryotes harbor RNA and retrotranscribing viruses. However, notable exceptions exist, and most viral genome types are spread across different domains. Generally, the similarity of sequences and virion structures is evident only up to the family level. In isolated cases, sequence homology can be detected between proteins of viruses with unrelated architecture, but it is unclear whether this can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer between ancestors of viral families or if this is a sign of a genuine evolutionary link, as discussed in great detail in [7, 8] and other related work. It is hypothesized that in certain cases, the conserved viral genes are witnesses of evolutionary processes as ancient as the origin of life itself [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
