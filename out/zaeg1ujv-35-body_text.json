In mammalian cells, hierarchical phosphorylation has been described for ␤-catenin, in which Ser45 phosphorylated by CK1␣ primes it for hyperphosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) (38, 39) , which triggers its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (40) . A similar phosphorylation mechanism has recently been described for nonstructural protein NS5A of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with the hyperphosphorylation cascade primed by the initial phosphorylation of serine 225 by CK1␣ and the subsequent phosphorylation of neighboring residues involving other kinases (41, 42) . Moreover, NS5A phosphorylation has been shown to play a key role in controlling the establishment of replication complexes during HCV infection (43) . Similarly, a number of other nonstructural viral proteins have been shown to undergo multiple phosphorylation events during virus infection, suggesting that these complex posttranslational modifications play a pivotal role in orchestrating the assembly of replication-competent viral factories (44) (45) (46) . BHK-T7 cells (baby hamster kidney stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase) were cultured in Glasgow medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 g/ml gentamicin (Biochrom AG), 2% nonessential amino acids (NEAA), and 1% glutamine.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
