Recombinant NSP5 mutant RVs were grown in MA-NSP5 cells, and the lysate was serially diluted 2-fold and used to infect MA-NSP5 cells, seeded in 24-well plates with coverslips. After 1 h of adsorption, virus was removed, and cells were incubated at 37°C. Nuclei were stained with ProLong diamond antifade mountant with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) (Thermo Scientific). Samples were imaged using a confocal setup (Zeiss Airyscan equipped with a 63ϫ objective with a numerical aperture [NA] of 1.3). Each viroplasm-containing cell was counted as one focus-forming unit (FFU). The average number of cells with viroplasms of six fields of view per each virus dilution was determined, and the total number of cells containing viroplasms in the whole preparation was estimated. The virus titer was determined as:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
