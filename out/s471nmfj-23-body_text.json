The activation of HSF1 is controlled by phosphorylation. Studies have shown that CVB3 activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which phosphorylates HSF1 at serine 230 . In this study, we determined the phosphorylation of HSF1 at serine 326, which also promotes the activation of HSF1 (Chou et al., 2012) . As shown in Figure 4F , the phosphorylation level of HSF1 at serine 326 was significantly elevated in the cells overexpressing VP1, indicating that the increased expression of Hsp70 is induced by the activation of HSF1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
