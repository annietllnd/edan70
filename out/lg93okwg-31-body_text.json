The cells were induced using 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for 18 h at 20˚C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 17.8 μg/mL phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 40 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was incubated with nickel beads for 1 h before being loaded onto a gravity flow column (Bio-Rad). The nickel beads were washed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were eluted with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The eluted proteins were further purified using size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-300; GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Relevant fractions from size-exclusion chromatography were pooled and the proteins were concentrated to 9.4 mg/mL (wild-type) and 11 mg/mL (mutant), and stored at -80˚C.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
