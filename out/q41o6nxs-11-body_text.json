International collaborations on policies, programmes and initiatives in the Arctic have supported the integration of stakeholders and disciplines since human health became a specific focus for research in 1957 with the establishment of the Nordic Council committee for Arctic Medical Research (25,26) (see Table I ). Two working groups under the Artic Council focussing on human health include the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program and the Sustainable Development Working Group formed in 1991 and 1998, respectively (9) . In 2010, the Arctic Council established the Arctic Human Health Expert Group (AHHEG) to more fully integrate the assessment of human health risks with environmental issues (27) . The Charter of the AHHEG is to advance collaboration between all stakeholders on integrated efforts to attendant human health issues with knowledge gained through environmental and community-based research. In 2011, the Health Ministries of the Arctic States issued the Nuuk Declaration, which describes the prioritized areas of concern and actions on health issues and specifically identifies circumpolar cooperation on assessing climate change impacts on health (28) . Also in 2011, the Arctic Council established the International Circumpolar Surveillance Climate Change and Infectious Disease Group to strengthen the integration of animal and human health systems to minimize disease emergence in the Arctic (18, 29, 30) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
