AY187029.1) using Stellaris Probe Designer v2 software (LCG Biosearch Technologies), in a total volume of 200 l of the hybridization buffer (Stellaris RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] hybridization buffer, SMF-HB1-10 [Biosearch Technologies], supplemented with 10% [vol/vol] deionized formamide). After 4 to 8 h of incubation at 37°C in a humidified chamber, samples were briefly rinsed with the wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 10% [vol/vol] formamide in nuclease-free water), after which a fresh aliquot of 300 l of the wash buffer was applied to each sample and incubated twice at 37°C for 30 min. After 2 washes, nuclei were briefly stained with 300 nM DAPI solution in 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, and the samples were finally rinsed with and stored in the same buffer without DAPI prior to imaging.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
