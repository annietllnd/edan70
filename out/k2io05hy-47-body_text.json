ORFx appeared to encode a protein with the potential to bind dsRNA that was tentatively named as VP6db [18] . However, in line with previous orbivirus protein nomenclature, we have renamed these proteins, based on their theoretical size and absence from the virion, as non-structural protein 4 (NS4). GIV NS4 was previously shown to contain significant aa sequence matches with dsRNA-binding domains [18] . Further analyses of their amino acid sequences indicate that NS4 may be structured as 'coiled-coils' and that BTV NS4 exhibits significant relatedness (as identified by the pfam programme) with nucleic acid binding proteins that also have coiled-coils or helical structures and are associated with ER or cell membranes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
