Given broad substrate specificity, the active site of dihydropyrimidinase can accommodate many different substrates. Therefore, substrate analogs cannot be specifically recognized and cannot significantly inhibit its activity. Although we found that dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, and acetohydroxamate inhibited dihydropyrimidinase activity, their IC 50 values were at the millimolar range and higher than the K m values of dihydropyrimidinase, which were insufficient as potent inhibitors. To determine whether a naturally occurring product is an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase, the inhibitory capabilities of the flavonols myricetin (with three hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic ring), quercetin (with two hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic ring), kaempferol (with one hydroxyl substituent on the aromatic ring), and galangin (without hydroxyl substituent on the aromatic ring) were tested. Furthermore, to study the structure-inhibition relationship with dihydropyrimidinase, the derivatives of myricetin, namely, dihydromyricetin (the ring does not contain a double bond but has additional two hydrogen atoms) and myricitrin (the ring is fused to an additional sugar block), were further used and tested (Fig 3A) .
