Cats with FIP exhibited significantly higher myocardial IL-1β (p = 0.008), IL-6, and TNF-α (both p < 0.001) transcription than control cats. When control cats were split by age, older cats retained the significant differences for all three cytokines (p < 0.001) whereas only TNF-α was significantly lower in the young control cats than in cats with FIP (Table 4 ). There were no significant differences between cats with systemic inflammatory diseases and FIP or between cats with FIP with and without effusions., These FIP subgroups (with and without effusions) were compared in turn to the other groups, with results almost identical to those obtained using the combined FIP group. The exception was in comparing FIP cats without effusions to controls, which were not significantly different despite the combined FIP group and FIP cats with effusions showing significantly higher transcription levels than controls (displayed graphically in Figure 3 ).
