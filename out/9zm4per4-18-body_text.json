The extensive coaxial stacking and parallel stem stacking interactions are likely to contribute at least this much to the free energy of the structure. The P1 and P3 stems are easily obtained with vsfold5, but P2 and P7 (the neck of the structure) appear quite difficult to obtain without introducing corrections that address these complex coaxial stacking and parallel stem configurations as well as permitting a variable Kuhn length in the design of the program.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
