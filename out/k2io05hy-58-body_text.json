At 72 hours post-infection NS4 was absent from the nucleus which could be the consequence of changes affecting the nucleus and the integrity of the nuclear membrane. The presence of the NS4 in the plasma membrane late in infection suggests that it may play a role, alongside NS1 and NS3, in virus exit. Further co-localisation studies will be carried out to assess NS4 interactions with other viral or cellular protein components. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
