Nipah virus is a deadly emerging paramyxovirus that enters host cells using two envelope glycoproteins; the attachment (G) protein that binds to cell receptors [103, 205] , and the fusion (F) glycoprotein that subsequently implements membrane fusion (PMID: 21511478). Paramyxovirus F proteins, unlike the other class I fusion proteins, described above, do not participate in receptor binding and exhibit significantly varied protein architectures compared to other class I fusion proteins [206] . However, they all share similarities in the utilisation of N-linked glycans to protect against the humoral immune response. Nipah virus F protein possesses 5 PNGs per protomer, which does not indicate the presence of an extensive shield that occludes much of the protein surface, as exemplified in Fig. 3 . The lack of a dense glycan shield is likely related to the fact that the N-linked glycans on Nipah F modulates the efficiency of membrane fusion and viral entry [207] . Nevertheless, these carbohydrate moieties have been shown to protect virions from neutralisation by antibodies, suggesting a trade-off between the evolutionary advantage of increased protection against the immune system and the effects on protein functionality. As a surface-displayed protein, Nipah virus G protein is also under immunological pressure and Nlinked glycans on the G protein have been shown to play a role in shielding virions against antibody neutralization [208] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
