About 1 ml of this fecal mixture was taken, centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 200 µL of supernatant, 800 µL of proteinase buffer, and 4 µL of proteinase K enzyme were added and incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 1 h. 800 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1) and 100 µL of 5 M sodium acetate were added and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. Then, 1 ml of isopropanol was added to the supernatant and kept at −20°C for 1 h or overnight incubation and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the pellet and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The ethanol was discarded and the pellet air dried. 30-50 µL of nuclease free water was added to the air-dried pellet and stored at −80°C until use.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
