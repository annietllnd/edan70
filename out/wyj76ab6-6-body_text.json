The choice of model viruses is of great importance when establishing such a standard test method. The requirements for model viruses include high resistance to disinfectants and drying, combined with simple virus propagation in cell culture (e.g. growing in high titres). The experts in WG1 suggested the enveloped virus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as the reference virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. This virus has been shown to produce similar results to vaccinia virus strain Elstree in virucidal testing [9] , and was chosen because of its low biosafety level that means it does not pose any hazard to employees performing the tests [10] , its known environmental stability and its practicability for laboratory use [11, 12] . In contrast, EBOV is a lethal virus and requires the highest biosafety levels for any investigation. Therefore, it is only available for testing in a few laboratories worldwide.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
