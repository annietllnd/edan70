As important molecular chaperone, Hsp70 plays critical role in protein folding, membrane translocation of proteins, and protein degradation via proteasome pathway (Nitika, and Truman, 2017) . The expression of Hsp70 is often induced by cellular stress such as infection, ischemia, inflammation, and exposure to oxidants (Shamovsky and Nudler, 2008; Radons, 2016) . Previous studies have demonstrated that up-regulated Hsp70 during CVB3 infection promotes viral replication (Helmbrecht et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2016; . CVB3 hijacks the host cell to produce viral RNA and proteins by shutting down the cap-dependent translation of cellular proteins, while the translation of viral proteins relies on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of viral genome (Bonderoff and Lloyd, 2008; Ullmer and Semler, 2018) . However, the translation of Hsp70 depends on IRES rather than cap-dependent . This ensures that its synthesis is not interfered by CVB3 infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
