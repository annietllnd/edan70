We now describe the optimization scheme, starting with the case F = 0. In this reading frame, Y′ is coded on the antisense strand in register with X′: each codon of Y′ overlaps with a single X′ codon on the opposite strand. To maximize the similarity score (Eq. (1)), we simply choose the optimal nucleotides for each pair of base-paired codons, by comparing the 64 possible choices and picking the one that gives the largest contribution to S(X′, Y′).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
