The genes were determined to be differentially expressed if the fold change (FC) was greater than 1.5 in up-or down-regulation. Statistical differences in gene expression were determined with a Student's t-test at p â‰¤ 0.05 and also a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was used as a threshold. The lists of candidate genes identified by GeneSpring analysis were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program (IPA; https ://www.qiage nbioi nform atics .com/produ cts/ingen uity-pathw ay-analy sis/) to identify most biologically relevant changes. Separate lists of up-and down-regulated genes were analyzed using Canonical Pathway analysis, which used right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test to identify pathways enriched in the gene set compared to the reference set of genes which included all genes in the human genome.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
