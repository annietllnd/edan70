In the innate immune system, the functions of NK cells, macrophages (fewer number and less efficient antigen presentation) and neutrophils (impaired chemotaxis, degranulation and phagocytosis) are decreased with aging [140] . Age-related changes in the adaptive immune system include diminished/altered cytokine patterns (Th2 bias), reduction in clonal expansion and function of antigenspecific T and B cells and a decline in antigen-presenting cell function [140] . Humoral immunity also exhibits changes albeit to a lesser extent, particularly the diminished ability to generate high-affinity protective antibodies against infectious agents. Splenic and activated peritoneal macrophages from aged mice express significantly lower levels of all TLRs and macrophages from aged mice secrete significantly lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-when stimulated with known TLR ligands [140] . Poly (ICLC) was able to effectively protect aged mice against lethal murine cytomegalovirus infection and effectively induced IFN [141] . Similarly, severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were almost completely protected against murine cytomegalovirus infection by poly (ICLC), and poly (ICLC) was able to induce IFN and NK cell cytotoxicity in these mice [141] . These results suggest that, although TLR3 receptors are reduced during the aging process, poly (ICLC) still has the potential to be effective [54] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
