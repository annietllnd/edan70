It should be noted that factors representing low socioeconomic status, such as low level of maternal education, low family income, and lack of dental insurance, were associated with a minimum of fourfold increased dental caries experience. Child oral health practices, such as failure to brush teeth at least once a day, failure to start brushing on or before a child attained 2 years of age, and visiting dentist for symptomatic treatment, were associated with dental caries experience in children. Children habituated to sleeping with bottle in mouth experienced 4.4-fold higher dental caries compared to children not practicing this habit (aOR = 4.4, 95% CI 1. 4-13.4 ). In addition, lack of mixed feeding and consuming two or more sugary snack items between meals were predominantly associated with dental caries experience (p < 0.05). Dietary habits, such as less consumption of fresh fruits and frequent consumption of soft drinks and flavored milk, were significantly associated with dental caries with an odds ratio of 11.6, 5.3, and 7.7, respectively. The final model was well calibrated (p = 0.7667; Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test) with very high discriminatory power (c-statistic = 99%) and high overall performance (adjusted R-square of 88%).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
