Proteins derived from rRV-infected cellular extract were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel for 2 h at 35 mA and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore; IPVH00010) for 1 h 30 min at 300 mA (24) . For protein analysis, membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-NSP5 (1:5,000) (16), anti-VP2 (1:5,000) (10), and anti-NSP2 guinea pig sera (1:2,000). The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig sera (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Mouse HRP-conjugated anti-actin monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:35,000) (clone AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
