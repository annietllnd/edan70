The two proteins localize to different subcellular compartments (Fig. 8A) , suggesting that the IC activity of the two proteins regulates ion transport between different compartments. E protein locates in the ERGIC (56) and induces calcium efflux during SARS-CoV infection, which activates the inflammasome complex, leading to the acute proinflammatory response associated with virus pathogenicity (34, 58) . As protein 3a is not found at any of the main intracellular Ca 2Ï© storage locations (Fig. 8B) , its IC activity most likely induces cellular pathways that are less relevant to pathogenesis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
