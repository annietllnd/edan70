In agreement herewith FIPV, which requires processing by lysosomal proteases, was also shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin-cleavage site consensus sequence in the S protein immediately upstream of the FP, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
