Hence, any conformational changes induced by receptor binding to the S1 RBD are more likely to be caused by the absence of the S1 RBD contacts in the 'up' conformation, rather than the formation of additional intra-spike contacts in a receptor-bound state (Supplementary Fig. S8) . Indeed, movement of the S1 RBD to the 'up' conformation disrupts molecular interactions with the S2 central Î±-helices which may play a role in receptor-induced conformational changes in wild-type spikes. The observation that host-receptor engagement of the S1 RBD disrupts interactions within spike in a manner independent of direct receptor-spike contacts suggests a flexible mechanism for how different coronavirus spikes may bind to diverse protein receptors with their S1 RBD and facilitate fusion with host cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
