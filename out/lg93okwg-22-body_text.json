In spite of these diverse and important functions, the structural organization of FLASH remains largely unknown. Although FLASH consists of nearly 2,000 amino acid residues, the functions of only three small regions of the protein are understood: a 100 residue segment in the N-terminus required for histone pre-mRNA processing, the C-terminal segment which forms a SANT/Myb-like domain, interacts with the C-terminal region of NPAT, and is required for localization to the histone locus body [31] ; and a small central region which binds Ars2 [32] is essential for cell cycle progression.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
