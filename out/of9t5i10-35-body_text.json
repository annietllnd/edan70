In mice, decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, apoptosis of lymphocytes in the spleen and lung and detection of cytokines in the brain are associated with influenza H5N1 pathology. Furthermore, the NS1 protein of HPIA virus inhibits IRF3 and the general IFN signaling pathway, thus mediating evasion of the hosts antiviral IFNmediated defences [64] . Theoretically, for non-specific immune stimulators to be effective in influenza H5N1 viral infection, they should overcome the insensitivity to IFN and should prevent apoptosis of lymphocytes without contributing further to cytokine dysregulation. Prevention of apoptosis of T cells could potentially increase TNF-, IFN-, IL-2, -3, -4, -5, -9, -10 and -15. Preferably, TNF-would not be induced by the non-specific immune stimulator as it is already highly induced by influenza A H5N1 viral infection, although mice deficient for TNF-or its receptors had no reduction in mortality when infected with A/Vietnam/ 1203/04 (H5N1) suggesting that TNF-alone is not responsible for the increased mortality of H5N1 influenza viruses [73] . Inhibition of the cytokine response by cortico-sterone, the natural mouse glucocorticoid, was not sufficient to prevent death, regardless of when the drug was administered, [73] suggesting that factors other than the cytokine storm are important for lethality.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
