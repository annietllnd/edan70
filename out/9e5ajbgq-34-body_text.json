A self-administered questionnaire was used as the main study instrument, which is subjected to recall bias. However, we do not expect our results to be grossly affected by recall, owing to recurrent and current themes tested in the questionnaire. For example, we would expect a more accurate recollection of tooth brushing habits and child feeding practices that were routine activities performed in the recent past; collection of information on flavored milk, a recent trend in Saudi Arabia, serves as an example for current themes. The study sample was restricted to 6-8-year-old male primary school children in Riyadh city of Saudi Arabia, which warrants caution in generalizing the results to the entire country; however, given the cultural homogeneity and urbanity of the area, we would expect our estimates to be relevant to general population. Our study does not support generalizing the results to girl children, as our sample was restricted to boys to comply with school regulations and cultural sensitivities of Saudi population. Although some of our findings could be relevant to girls owing to shared cultural practices, future research should evaluate and confirm gender-related differences. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of this study warrants against drawing causal inferences.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
