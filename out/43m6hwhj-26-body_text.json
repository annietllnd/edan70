GZMA induces caspase-independent cell death with morphological features of apoptosis, when delivered into the target cell through the immunological synapse [58] . In another study the apoptotic cells were found both in Band T-cell areas of lymphoid organs, suggesting that the apoptosis might play a role in the impairment of the host immune response during PRRSV infection [59] . It is not excluded that in addition to a caspase pathway of apoptosis also caspase-independent mechanism of immunological cells death can be used by PRRSV to debilitate immunological answer to infection, what could explain high up-regulation of GZMA gene expression observed in our analysis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
