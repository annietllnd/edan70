Whilst the exact function of shed GP1 is yet to be elucidated, it has been proposed that it may act as an immunological decoy in a manner akin to Ebola sGP. In the case of Lassa virus, the soluble GP1 structure [116] is conformationally distinct to that presented on the trimeric GPC [117] , further highlighting its potential function as an immune decoy, since shed GP1 will likely present a non-functional conformation, and thereby elicit non-neutralising antibodies. The conservation of such substantial structural rearrangements of isolated GP1 subunits from other Old World arenaviruses, such as Loei River [118] and Morogoro virus [119] may highlight a conserved mechanism of immune evasion amongst these pathogens.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
