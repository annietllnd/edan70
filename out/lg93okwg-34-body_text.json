Three datasets from three different crystals were processed using XDS and merged with XSCALE [43, 44] . The structure was solved by SAD using ShelxCDE [45] and the model built manually with the program Coot [46] . The final structure was then refined using a higher resolution dataset (2.6 Å) collected at ALS beamline 501 (wavelength: 0.9774 Å) and processed with XDS. Data for the structures of FLASH NTD C54S/ C83A were collected using single crystals at APS beamline 24-ID-E (0.9792 Å wavelength for both). The datasets were processed using HKL2000 [47] (FLASH C54S/C83A crystal form 1) and XDS (FLASH C54S/C83A crystal form 2). Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser [48] with the selenomethionyl FLASH NTD structure as the search model. All three structures were refined using Phenix [49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
