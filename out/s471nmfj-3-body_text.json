To sustain viral replication, the cellular environment must be manipulated to provide adequate raw materials for the biosynthesis of the virus (Schang, 2003; Ning et al., 2017; Torshizi et al., 2017; Wang Z.Y. et al., 2017; Wasson et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017) . A variety of DNA viruses manipulate cell cycle to achieve a cellular condition which is favorable to viral replication. Parvovirus induces cell cycle arrest which contributes to the virus-induced cytopathic effect (Chen and Qiu, 2010) . Papillomaviruses encode proteins that are able to promote cell proliferation through overcoming G1/S restriction point (R point) (Wasson et al., 2017) . Herpesviruses arrest cells in the late G1 phase prior to DNA synthesis (Oster et al., 2005; Paladino et al., 2014) . RNA viruses also develop strategies to influence cell cycle in order to create an environment which is beneficial to viral replication (Dove et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2015; Gluck et al., 2017; Ning et al., 2017; Wang Z.Y. et al., 2017) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
