However, the inflammatory cells likely played a minor role in the overall hepatic transcription, since we extracted RNA from tissue specimens without grossly visible FIP lesions and generally found immunohistological evidence of more consistent cytokine expression by hepatocytes than by inflammatory cells. The different antibodies showed variation in their staining patterns, being either relatively diffuse or showing more varying intensity between hepatocytes. The precise cause of this is unknown but may reflect variations in cytokine expression and release beyond the scope of this study.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
