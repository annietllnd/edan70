The mutant lacking the tail (NSP5/ΔT) has been previously reported as phosphorylation negative when expressed alone in MA104 cells and unable to multimerize (32), while unpublished data from our lab indicated that the NSP5/ Δ176-180 mutant also showed no hyperphosphorylation. Despite the presence of Ser67, and the lack of Thr and Ser residues within the deletions, both mutants did not show a classical hyperphosphorylation pattern (Fig. 4A ) and failed to replicate, confirmed by the absence of de novo synthesis of genomic dsRNA (Fig. 4B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
