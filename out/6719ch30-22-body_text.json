We and others have used the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model to investigate immunemediated mechanisms of brain injury within the context of acute CNS viral infection [3, 6] . Despite differences in nomenclature, host genetics, and details of the viral strain and inoculum, a general consensus has emerged that monocytic cells infiltrate the brain within hours of infection and create an inflammatory environment that kills neurons and alters neural circuitry. Understanding the mechanisms that drive monocyte infiltration may therefore reveal novel strategies to protect the brain.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
