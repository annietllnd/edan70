From 2001, Asian I increased in Cambodia and Vietnam until finally in 2007 Asian I became the predominant genotype in Indochina. The genotype Asian I viruses in Thailand seemed to be widely disseminated into Vietnam via Cambodia but did not reach Malaysia and Bangladesh (Figure 2) . Thus, the Asian American genotype was replaced by Asian I in Cambodia and Vietnam between 1998 and 2011. This example also suggests the idea of genotype transition, which probably reflects the mosquito vector habitat and human activities in the Indochinese Peninsula.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
