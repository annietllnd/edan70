The global Moran's I statistic was used to assess the presence, strength and direction of spatial autocorrelation over the whole study area, using a queen's contiguity weights matrix and 499 random permutations. A p-value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered significant. The Local Moran's I and GI* statistics were used to detect clustering of provinces with similar risk of H5N1 or H5N6, and to identify the locations of province-level hot and/or cold spots. The GI* statistic returned a z-score for each province and for statistically significant positive z-scores, the larger the z-score the more intense the clustering of high values (hot spot). For statistically significant negative z-scores, the smaller the z-score the more intense the clustering of low values (cold spot). All spatial analyses were conducted using tools provided in ArcGIS 10.3.1 (28) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
