Grobbelaar et al. suggested that the use of Smithburn strain in endemic countries could result in the spread of RVFV strain by multiple use of automatic syringes for both viremic and uninfected ruminants during outbreaks, and may have resulted in reassortment of Smithburn strain with circulating wt RVFV during an outbreak [11] . Thus, a live-attenuated RVF vaccine that contains virulent subpopulations or non-attenuated segments, should not be used in viremic animals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
