Total dsRNA extracted from 1 g of the diatom colony was analyzed using the FLDS method. PCR amplicons were not observed in the dsRNAspecific RNaseIII-treated sample prior to reverse transcription (Fig. S3) . As a result of de novo assembly and manual extension, we obtained 42 composite viral contigs (Table 1  and Table S3 ). More than 98.2% of reads were mapped to these 42 contigs (Table 2 ) as in the case of the model experiment described above. Both terminal ends of 31 of the viral contigs were identified and recognized as full-length viral genome segments. The terminal sequences of the full-length segments were used to identify segment compositions for some of the viral species because terminal sequences are highly conserved between segments in some dsRNA viral genomes for viral RNA replication and/or encapsidation (19) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
