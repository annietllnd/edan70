Moreover, the p38 pathway is also activated in cells overexpressing the SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a [65] and 7a [66] , although the physiological significance during an actual infection has not been fully examined. Coronavirus-induced p38 activation is likely mediated by the upstream kinase MKK3/6, which is phosphorylated in cells infected with MHV [67] and IBV [63] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
