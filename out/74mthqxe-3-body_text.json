Originally identified through RNAi genetic screening and shown to inhibit infections by influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus and Dengue virus, the IFITM proteins are now known to potently restrict entry and infections by a number of highly pathogenic viruses, including HIV-1, filovirus, and SARS coronavirus [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . In humans, there are at least 4 functional members of IFITM proteins; IFITM1, 2 and 3 are expressed in a variety of human tissues and cell lines, IFITM5 is limited to the bone and is involved in mineralization [11] . All of these human IFITM proteins have been shown to restrict viral entry and infection, with IFITM3 being generally thought to be the most potent [12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18] . A recent study demonstrated that the IFITM3 protein significantly restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, further underscoring the crucial role of IFITM3 in vivo [19] . Yount and colleagues recently showed that the mouse IFITM3 protein is not only palmitoylated but also ubiquitinated, and that these posttranslational modifications distinctly regulate the cellular localization of IFITM3 and its anti-influenza activities [20, 21] . While it has been suggested that viral membrane fusion may be blocked by IFITMs [12, 13, 15] , direct evidence is still lacking and exactly how IFITM proteins restrict virus entry and infection is currently not known.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
