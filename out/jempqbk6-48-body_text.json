Additionally, structural analysis led to new findings, e.g., it allowed us to identify an interesting example of envelope glycoproteins that are related to a cell-cell fusion protein and also resolve the evolutionary history of hemagglutinin-esterase introduction into Coronaviridae. These few examples hint at the potential multitude and scale of these events, which can be only fully appreciated if more data on three-dimensional structure of viral proteins become available, which may paint a much more complex picture of viral evolution than previously expected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
