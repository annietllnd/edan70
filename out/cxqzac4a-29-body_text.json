During EOPM analysis of clinical samples, the immune response genes show dramatic up-or downregulation in the target samples compared with the normal reference (data not shown). So far we have not found any reliable relationships between the immune response genes Figure 2 User interface of the EOPM software. Users will generally only need to input raw microarray data for pathogen identification. and the pathogen categories. The overall clinical information for patients and normal controls should also be comprehensively analyzed. Human immune related genes in peripheral blood show dramatic differences in expression even in a normal population, with differences correlated with sex, age, and sampling time, amongst other factors [23, 24] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
