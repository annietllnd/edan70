{"cord_uid":"iwfidoer", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC4791113", "divid":6, "text":"The PC3-T7 loop primer (5′-p-GGA TCC CGG GAA TTC GGT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT ATT TTT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT A-OH-3′) was ligated to fragmented dsRNA as described by Potgieter et al. (34) , and dsRNA was then purified using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). After the addition of DMSO at a final concentration of 15% (v/v), dsRNA was denatured at 95°C for 3 min and snap-frozen in ice-water slurry. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA from the ligated loop primer region using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). After excess and hybrid RNAs were removed (34) , cDNA was desalted and concentrated using the MinElute PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). Primary cDNA strands were re-annealed by lowering the temperature from 95 to 50°C, as described previously (30) . Second strand DNA polymerization was performed using KOD-plus Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with a primer complementary to the partial sequence of the PC3-T7 loop primer, PC2 (5′-CCG AAT TCC CGG GAT CC-3′) (34) . After heat activation of KOD-plus Neo in the reaction mixture provided at 96°C for 2 min, template cDNA was added and incubated at 68°C for 5 min. After the reaction, cDNA was amplified under the following conditions: 96°C for 2 min, 25 (for MoCV1-A) or 18 (for diatom colony) cycles of 98°C for 10 s, and 68°C for 2 min. Small cDNA and primer dimers were removed using the 1.25 × SPRIselect reagent kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) according to the Left Side Size Selection procedure in the manufacturer's protocol.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
