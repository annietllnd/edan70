For an epidemic to be first initiated in the at-risk country on day d, it must have not been initiated on all previous days. Hence the probability distribution of the time delay (D 1 ) until the epidemic is first initiated in the at-risk country following identification in the source region is described by:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
