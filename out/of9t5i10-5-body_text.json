TLR3 is constitutively expressed in nasal epithelial cells [28] , alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells [29] , T, NK [8, 21] and mast cells [17] , and its expression is positively regulated by influenza A virus, rhinovirus, RSV and by dsRNA [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Demonstration that the more differentiated airway epithelial cells have increased resistance to rhinovirus infection suggests an important role for TLR3 in some respiratory tract infections [28] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
