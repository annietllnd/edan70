In addition to participant evaluations, detailed After Action Reports (AARs) were developed for each exercise that summarized the exercise discussions and highlighted key aspects of each exercise. In January 2013, health leaders who were involved in the planning of the exercises from a subset of countries participated in brief semistructured face-to-face interviews to discuss how their country followed up with the exercises and the current state of their exercise program. Health leaders included health officials working for the ministry of health in their respective countries. These health leaders were all directors of departments (such as communicable disease) within their ministry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
