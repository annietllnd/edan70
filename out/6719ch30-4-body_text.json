Viral encephalitis is a trade-off between the need to clear pathogen from the brain and the need to preserve irreplaceable neurons and neural circuits: too little inflammation and the host dies of uncontrolled infection, too much inflammation and the host suffers permanent brain damage [1] . And while much attention is rightly given to viral encephalitides associated with human mortality, there is likely a significant component of neural injury associated with low-level, sub-clinical viral infections of the central nervous system that are ultimately cleared by the host. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a model of such an infection [2] . When C57Bl/6 mice are inoculated via intracranial delivery of the Daniel's strain of TMEV, there is an acute viral encephalitis that culminates in the generation of an antiviral T cell-mediated response, development of virus neutralizing antibodies, clearance of the virus, and resolution of brain inflammation over the course of about 45 days [3] . However, despite essentially complete resolution of the infection, permanent neurological sequelae such as impaired spatial learning [2, 4] , anxiety [5] , and epilepsy [6] occur in most postinfectious animals. Uniquely, these neurologic problems largely stem from bystander loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons and subsequent disruption of hippocampal and hippocampalcortical circuits [4, 7, 8] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
