Cells were infected with rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E or rVSV-prM-E-NS1 and the cell culture medium was harvested at 24-48 h postinfection. Two types of particles, VSV (yellow arrow) and ZIKV VLPs (white arrow) ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5A ), were detected by negative-staining and electron microscopy. After separation by CsCl isopycnic gradient centrifugation, a large number of low density ZIKV VLPs were obtained from rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 infected cells ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5B , C). The ZIKV VLPs expressed by VSV had a diameter of 30-40 nm, which are relatively smaller than native ZIKV virions (40-50 nm) ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5E , F). No VLPs were detected in cell culture medium from cells infected with rVSV-E ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5D ). Therefore, these results confirm that expression of prM-E and prM-E-NS1 but not E alone by the VSV vector resulted in the assembly of VLPs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
