The degradation of CD4 involves the interaction of Vpu and CD4 via their cytoplasmic domains, followed by recruitment of β -TrCP to the Vpu-CD4 complex, which leads to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of CD4 10 . In this case, Vpu acts as a linker between CD4 and β -TrCP. In contrast, enhancement of virus release involves the TM domain of Vpu to counteract the antiviral activity of tetherin 11 . Vpu also downregulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II 12 and tetraspanin proteins 13,14 from the cell surface. It has been reported that Vpu also protects HIV-1-infected cells from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) through down-regulation of CD4 and tetherin 15 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
