Stimulation of TLR3, however, results in the recruitment of TIR-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM)/TIR-domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-(TRIF). The dissociation of TRIF activates a complex consisting of the kinases I B kinase inducible (IKKi or IKK ), TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and the scaffolding protein tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-3. This leads to the activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 and the expression of IFN-inducible genes such as those encoding IFN-, IFN-, and genes involved in T cell stimulation such as CD40, CD80 and CD86. TRIF recruitment is also responsible for activation of the nuclear factor B (NF B) through interaction with the TRAF-6 complex [24, 34] . This leads to the transcription of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-and the stabilization of inflammatory response protein mRNAs through the AUrich elements in the 3' untranslated region [34] . MyD88, although not part of the signalling pathway for TLR3, may play a role in the negative regulation of TLR3-induced mucin production [35] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
