All cats had been euthanased and submitted for diagnostic post mortem examination with full owner consent. They were necropsied within 1 h of death. Pleuritis involving the outer pericardium was observed in one of the FIP cats, however, neither this cat nor any of the others exhibited any gross changes in the heart. 14 of the 18 cats with FIP had effusions (data was unavailable for one animal). Hearts were removed and samples collected from both atria, both ventricular free walls, and the interventricular septum into RNAlater TM Stabilization Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ilkirch Cedex, France) and stored at −80 • C until RNA extraction. The remaining heart was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24-48 h, trimmed, routinely paraffin wax embedded and subjected to a histological examination. This did not reveal pathological changes in the myocardium of any of the cats.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
