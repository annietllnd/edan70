The PERK-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis limits nascent protein transport to ER lumen, thereby attenuating the protein accumulation in ER. Interestingly, some proteins are preferetially translated when eIF2α is phosphorylated. One example is ATF4 [4] , a transcription factor that control the expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport and redox chemistry. GADD34 is one of downstream genes triggered by ATF4. As a regulator subunit, GADD34 helps PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α, thereby limiting PERK signaling as a negative feedback loop [5] . PERK signaling will be considered as part of translational control and will be discussed in Section 3.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
