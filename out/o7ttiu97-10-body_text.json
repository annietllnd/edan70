Volumes of interest (VOI) and corresponding maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax) were generated for any metabolically active lesions in the lung as well as background activity in the lungs, liver, heart, thymus, and thoracic lymph nodes. Baseline imaging prior to infection showed no focal areas of lung consolidation on CT and background standard uptake values (SUVMax) of the [ 18 F]-FDG levels ranged from 0.7-1.0 for PET ( Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A ). Each figure shows the one two-dimensional coronal plane that were standardized across days to provide a similar orientation and do not necessarily represent the SUVMax as that plane may be out of view.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
