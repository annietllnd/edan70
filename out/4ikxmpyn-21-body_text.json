However, viruses have evolved strategies to evade immune responses by limiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Some viruses have been reported to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation to circumvent innate immunity and facilitate viral replication (Figure 2) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
