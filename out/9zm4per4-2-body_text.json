RNA pseudoknots are a class of base pairing structures that appear in many viruses and may comprise as much as 10% of all RNA structures [3] . However, including the complete repertoire of pseudoknots in RNA structure prediction can drastically increase the demands on computational resources [4] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
