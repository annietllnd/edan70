IL-10 is reported to have an effect on immunoregulation [41] . It was suggested that IL-10 mediates protection from acute encephalitis and plays a central role in determining the clinical outcome of JEV infection [42] . Insufficient anti-inflammatory cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-10 in the brain is associated with increased tissue pathology [43] . IL-10 displays a neuroprotective function during JEV infection and regulates deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines [44] . Furthermore, an experiment using IL-10 KO mice showed that IL-10 signaling plays a negative role in immunity against WNV infection and blockade of IL-10 signaling helps to control viral infection [45] . Thus, the precise role of the IL-10 response following encephalitic flavivirus infection also remains to be resolved.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
