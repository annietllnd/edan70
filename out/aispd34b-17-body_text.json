Figure 1A and 1B show the transcript abundance of 59 full-length var genes and two var pseudogenes in NF54/3D7 as relative copy numbers normalized to the internal control, seryl-tRNA synthetase (PF07_0073). The percentage of ringstage parasites was determined by Giemsa staining (Figure  2 ), in addition to measurements of msp1 (PFI1475w) transcript abundance to control for stage specificity of each parasite population ( Figure 1A and 1B). For both cultures there was a clear peak in transcript abundance at ring stage, ~5-25 hours after invasion. Figure 1C shows the transcript abundance of each full-length var gene relative to total number of var transcripts, in which the proportion of the most abundant transcript was higher at ring stage compared to the schizont stage.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
