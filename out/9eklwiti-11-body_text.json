Etiologic determination of pneumonia and other LRTIs is typically challenging based on clinical assessment alone [31] . In addition, the collection of optimal specimens to detect the pathogenic etiology of LRTIs must be considered, given the specifics of a testing modality as well as the logistics of obtaining the specimens. Specimens can be collected using invasive (blood, thoracentesis, transthoracic needle aspiration, bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage, or protected specimen brush) or noninvasive techniques (induced or expectorated sputum, nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal/throat swab, and urine for antigen testing) [32] . However, colonization of the respiratory tract with various pathogens must be taken into account when determining appropriate treatment regimens based on sputum or naso/oropharyngeal swabs. In a study of 340 patients with CAP, culture and RT-PCR were used to compare plasma and respiratory (nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum or tracheal aspirates) samples [33] . In this study, RT-PCR for both plasma and respiratory samples identified S. pneumoniae more often than culture. However, good quality sputum samples are often challenging to obtain especially in the outpatient setting and from children.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
