Some $225 m. (of a total of $ 1.8 b.) was allocated to health-related international development assistance in 2003-4 budget of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). However, while Australia's contribution to HIV/AIDS control and its regional advisory role associated with SARS were acknowledged by the Foreign Affairs Minister in his report to Parliament, health assistance received little prominence. Security, good governance and counter-terrorism were emphasized as the focus for the official foreign aid programme. Support for essential services in Papua New Guinea continued as a major imperative [8] . The lower priority of health was further underscored by a decision to no longer appoint designated health advisors to the permanent staff of AusAID. It should be noted, however, that the emergence of SARS served to reinforce health as an important element on the international assistance agenda.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
