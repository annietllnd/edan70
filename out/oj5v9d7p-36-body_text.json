Importantly, Nrf2 was shown to restrict/prevent iron-or heme-mediated oxidative stress by affecting the expression of the FPN1, ferritin and HO-1 genes [250] . Regulation of the aforementioned antioxidants, NADPH-synthesizing enzymes, as well as others stress-response proteins are clearly shown to provide protection against oxidative and inflammatory damages [197, 203, 204, 251] . Accumulating evidence clearly shows that Nrf2 can also regulate many important biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis, mitochondrial function or biogenesis as well as several metabolic pathways involved in iron/heme, glucose, glutamine, lipid, NADPH and pentose phosphate metabolism (for review and references, see Reference [198] ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
