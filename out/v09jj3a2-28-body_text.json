Attack rates among workers with direct patient care roles have been observed as high as 10.0 and 11.8% in Canada and Hong Kong, respectively [5, 7] . This study examined early events after the admission of a patient with SARS-CoV infection into a small hospital, at a time before the risks from unprotected exposure to SARS patients were fully appreciated. Our findings highlight the potential SARS transmission risks to hospital workers from potentially infectious surfaces and from proximity to a symptomatic patient.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
