However, the abundance profile indicated that its transcription peaks earlier in the ring stage than the other var genes. Since the timing of the cycle of both lines were tightly correlated according to the Giemsa stain assessment, this observation is probably not due to major differences in synchronization. The protein expression of VAR2CSA did not seem to diverge from earlier reports showing that PfEMP1 molecules appear to be present on the infected erythrocyte membrane around 16-18 hours after invasion [45] [46] [47] . As expected, the recognition pattern of NF54VAR2CSA by rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant-produced DBL5Îµ of VAR2CSA was correlated with the recognition of the immune sera of malaria-exposed multi-gravidae women from a malaria endemic area.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
