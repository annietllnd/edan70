Because of the lack of data on group housing without automatic feeder labor time requirements, we assumed the median of an automatic feeder and individually housed heifers (5.5 mins/calf/day). Management labor was calculated separately to represent additional labor required from owners, managers, and/or family. Management followed the trend of 10% of the paid labor, creating the assumption of 0.55 mins/calf/day for group housing without an automatic feeder. Minutes per calf could be input directly or total time per all pre-weaned calves could be used to calculate total labor cost using Equation (2) . ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
