Finally, we further validated the protection efficacy of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice by monitoring body weight and viremia for a prolonged time (until day 21 after challenge with ZIKV). As shown in Fig. 8a , there were no significant differences in body weight gain among three groups (P > 0.05, ttest), 10 5 PFU of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, saline, and normal controls, demonstrating the high safety profile of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice. As expected, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 triggered a high level of E-specific (Fig. 8b) and NS1-specific 6 NS1 alone provides partial protection against ZIKV challenge. a-c Experiment in A129 mice. A129 mice were immunized with a single dose (10 5 PFU) of mtdVSV-based vaccine or two doses (50 µg each, two weeks apart) of DNA vaccine. At week 4 post-immunization, mice were intraperitoneally challenged with 10 5 PFU of ZIKV Cambodian strain. a Clinical score in A129 mice after ZIKV challenge. ZIKV-associated clinical signs were scored for each mouse. 1 = healthy; 2 = mild: ruffled fur but no neurological symptoms; 3 = moderate: ruffled fur, hindlimb weakness, and partial hindlimb paralysis; and 4 = severe: paralysis, moribund and early removal is required. b Body weight change in A129 mice after ZIKV challenge. After ZIKV challenge, body weight for each mouse was evaluated daily. The average body weights of five mice ± standard deviation were shown. c Body weight change of A129 mice in pCI-NS1 group after ZIKV challenge. Each line represents individual animal. One mouse had 10% of body weight loss and was recovered after ZIKV challenge. d Expression of ZIKV NS1 protein by rVSV-G1670A and pCI vectors. BSRT7 cells were infected by rVSV-G1670A-NS1 at an MOI of 3.0 or transfected with 4 µg of pCI-NS1, and cell lysates were harvested at day 3, and subjected to western blotting using ZIKV NS1 antibody. e-h Experiment in BALB/c mice. 4-week-old BLAB/c mice were immunized with two doses (50 µg each, two weeks apart) of pCI-NS1, or a single dose (10 6 PFU) of mtdVSV-NS1 or mtdVSV-prM-E. At week 4 post-immunization, mice were administered 1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody and challenged intravenously with 10 6 PFU of ZIKV Cambodian strain. e NS1-specific antibody response in BALB/c mice. P value (by Student's t-test) from top to bottom: ****P = 3.95 × 10 −5 , ****P = 3.48 × 10 −5 , ****P = 1.51 × 10 −5 , **P = 0.00183. Data shown are the GMT of 5 mice ± standard deviation. f E-specific antibody responses in BALB/c mice. Data shown are the GMT of 5 mice ± standard deviation. g NS1 alone provided partial protection against viremia in BALB/c mice at day 3 postchallenge. The level of viremia was measured by real-time RT-PCR at day 3 post-challenge. P value (by Student's t-test) from top to bottom: ****P = 4.15 × 10 −6 , ***P = 0.000161, ***P = 0.000767, ***P = 0.000187, *P = 0.0250. h NS1 alone provided protection against viremia in BALB/c mice at day 7 postchallenge. P value (by Student's t-test) from top to bottom: **P = 0.00510, ***P = 0.000114, **P = 0.00277, *P = 0.0308. Data shown are the mean of 5 mice. N.S., not significant ( Fig. 8c) antibodies. Upon challenge with ZIKV Cambodian strain, mouse body weight and viremia were monitored every 1 or 3 days until day 21. Mice that received the saline control were all dead at day 6 post-challenge (Fig. 8d) . The body weight in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group was indistinguishable with normal control (P > 0.05, t-test) at all time points (Fig. 8d) . Saline control group developed high levels of ZIKV induced viremia whereas rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group had a baseline level of viremia at day 3 and no detectable viremia between days 3 and 21 (Fig. 8e) . Collectively, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is of high safety and efficacy against ZIKV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
