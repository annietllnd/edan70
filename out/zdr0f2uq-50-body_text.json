For example, bnAbs PGT128, 145, and 151 display long heavy chain complementarity determining region-3 (HCDR3) loops that penetrate the glycan shield to make protein-protein contacts [161] (Fig. 4D) , and 2G12 that features a unique domain-exchange phenomenon [245, 305] , where the variable domains from the two heavy chains are exchanged, giving rise to a compact dual Fab architecture (Fig. 4E ). Since numerous anti-HIV-1 Env bnAbs specifically recognise areas of the glycan shield, the compositional conservation of glycans on HIV-1 Env has significant implications in immunogen design as any vaccine candidate would have to emulate the native glycosylation of infectious virions [169] , in order to elicit these bnAbs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
