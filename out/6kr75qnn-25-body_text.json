However, given the high phylogenetic diversity of bats, these cell lines may not always be appropriate to study batrelated zoonotic viruses in detail. Cell lines are needed that allow the study of virus-host interaction in a wide range of host species; species that may differ in many aspects, including not only their geographic distribution, ecology, and biology, but also most likely in their immunological and receptor-associated characteristics as well.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
