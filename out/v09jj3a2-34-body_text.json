The first is the small sample size employed for the nested case-control, which contributed to a general lack of precision in measures of effect (odds ratios), and precluded our ability to look for independent risk factors through multivariate analyses. In addition, because of the need to minimize the complexity of the questionnaire, we were unable to assess either the duration, or the intensity of potential exposures, both of which are likely to be important modifiers of absolute risk. However, our streamlined approach using generalized questions allowed us to rapidly survey a large fraction of the hospital worker population, rather than just medical professionals. Finally, there were several potential sources of bias in this study which could have affected our results and conclusions. Although we performed the study prior to closure of the hospital, while the staff were still actively engaged in the outbreak investigation, we failed to achieve full staff participation, particularly among physicians and certain categories of nurses. This could have introduced a selection bias favoring enrollment of persons with less opportunity for direct contact with the index patient. Similarly, we questioned individuals about their exposure to the index patient 13 days after he was transferred to Hong Kong, and used a proxy to complete exposure questionnaires for deceased individual. Either of these could have introduced non-systematic information (recall) bias to our findings. We attempted to minimize the influence of these potential sources of bias by using case investigation forms and physician notes to verify self-reported information when ever possible.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
