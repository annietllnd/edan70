Compared to the methods above, the advantages of BIE are evident, e.g., high-throughput multiplexed analysis and quantitative, label-free rapid testing. Previous applications of BIE mainly focus on the biomedical fields [17, 18] , such as high-throughput disease diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) marker [19, 20] , the detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) [21] and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) detection [22] . Thus, the biosensor technology offers important tools for disease diagnosis. As such, new applications have recently been developed, including those for the analysis of the interaction between tropomyosin allergens and antibodies [23] , and the interaction between soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins [24] . To date, however, BIE has not been applied for the detection of CMV antibody, particularly for the identification of the CMV IgG and IgM antibodies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
