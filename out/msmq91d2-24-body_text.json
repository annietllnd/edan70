Cells were infected with the indicated virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 0.01, and culture supernatants were collected at 72 hpi for viral titration. In VeroE6 cells, MP-12 and rMP12-PTNSs replicated to a similar level, while rMP12-C13type and rMP12-SFSNSs replicated slightly more efficiently than MP-12 ( Fig. 2A) . In MEF cells at 72 hpi, MP-12 replicated 1.51, 0.99 or 0.81 log more than rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs, respectively (Fig. 2B) . Subsequently, we determined viral growth kinetics in MRC-5 cells, because MRC-5 cells were used for the cultivation of MP-12 vaccine [36] . In MRC-5 cells, rMP12-SFSNSs did not replicate efficiently, and the replication kinetics was similar to that of rMP12-C13type, while rMP12-PTNSs replicated efficiently at the level nearly similar to that of MP-12 ( Fig. 2C) . At 72 hpi, MP-12 replicated 2.27, 0.54 or 2.14 log more than rMP12-C13type, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs, respectively (Fig. 2C) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
