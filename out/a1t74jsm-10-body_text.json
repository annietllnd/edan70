The closest 16S rRNA sequence found in GenBank (98.0% identity or 1320/1347 identical positions) came from an uncultured Anaplasma sp. isolated from Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks from Jeju Island, Korea (accession numbers GU075699 to GU075704) [40] and Beijing, China (JN715833) (Fig 1) . No groEL, gltA, or rpoB sequence is currently available for those isolates. The 16S rRNA sequence from our novel Anaplasmataceae bacterium shared 93.4% to 94.2% identity with characterized Anaplasma species and 91.1% to 91.6% identity with characterized Ehrlichia species (Fig 1A) . In comparison, previously characterized Anaplasma species share over 95.2% identity across the 16S rRNA gene and only 90.4% to 92.9% identity with Ehrlichia species. The groEL, gltA, and rpoB sequences from the novel microorganism had relatively low homology with other sequences in GenBank; the groEL sequences were slightly more similar to Ehrlichia than to Anaplasma sequences. Accordingly, the four gene trees place the novel California isolate (together with the related Chinese and Korean clones for 16S rRNA) on an intermediate branch that predates the radiation of all validated Anaplasma species (Fig 1A-1D) .
