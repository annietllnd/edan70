Consistent with the similarity of the induced signaling pathways, the spectrum of genes elicited by the two types of IFNs show a high overlap (2) . However, recent studies have demonstrated that type III IFNs are critical non-redundant antiviral mediators of type I IFNs in the GI tract (2) . To date, numerous studies in humans or mice have taken advantage of RNA-Seq or chip assays to show that IFN-λ and IFN-α elicit distinct downstream signaling events, even though many genes are induced by both type I and III IFNs (15, 16) . Mice with type I IFN or III IFN receptor knockout experience more severe viral intestinal infections, but Ifnl −/− mice show higher viral loads and more serious clinical symptoms than IFNAR −/− mice (17, 18) . Studies conducted by Pott et al. showed that intestinal epithelial cells exhibit stronger responses to IFN-λ compared with IFN-α/β in vivo (19, 20) . A comprehensive understanding of the unique signaling profiles of type I and III IFNs has become increasingly important for understanding host-virus interactions and the development of IFN-λ therapeutics. However, thus far, no direct comparative analyses of the transcriptional profiles induced by porcine type I vs. type III IFNs in swine intestinal epithelia have been performed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
