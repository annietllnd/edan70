New data, reported here and in other recent publications [37] , indicate that the socalled 'loose' transcription of several var transcripts per infected erythrocyte results from cross-hybridization artefacts and the background of gene expression from minority populations in cultures which are not expressing the dominant, selected var gene.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
