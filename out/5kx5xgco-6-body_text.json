They were required to respond to the scenario with the actions they would take if the scenario were actually occurring. Exercise facilitators were given discussion points and probes to keep the discussion focused and moving forward. Each section of the exercise ended with participants being asked to make concrete decisions for the topic area being discussed before moving on.
