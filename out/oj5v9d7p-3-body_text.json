Under mild stress conditions, homeostasis can be re-established by coordinated action of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. Further, a complex cascade of regulatory mechanisms is involved in the stress response which leads to metabolic changes (an increased mobilization of energy and a shift in metabolism) causing diminished live performance in poultry [14] . It should be mentioned that, in modern commercial poultry production, based on balanced diets and well-controlled environmental housing, stress-related nutritional metabolic diseases (e.g., encephalomalacia, exudative diathesis, muscular dystrophy) are sparse [6, 7, 15] ; however, stress-related decreases in productive and reproductive performance of poultry still cause substantial economic losses. Domestication and genetic selection for rapid growth, improved feed conversion and high egg production rates have made domestic birds, including broilers, layers and turkeys, particularly susceptible to oxidative stress [16] . In general, there are four major types of stress in the poultry industry: technological, environmental, nutritional and internal, which lead to detrimental changes at the molecular/cellular and physiological levels and, finally, decrease the productive and reproductive performance of commercial poultry [1, 2, 15] (Table 1) .
