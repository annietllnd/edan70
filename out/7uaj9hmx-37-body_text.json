Together, the data indicate that in porcine MDMs, TUL is able to block PRRSVinduced pseudopod formation, necrosis, pro-inflammatory CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production, and inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. In addition TUL also synergized with PRRSV to induce pro-resolution cell apoptosis and the production of anti-inflammaotry IL-10. The results also show that the protective modulation of macrophage structure, function, and behavior by TUL occurs in the absence of a direct anti-viral effect. The present observations pave the way towards further studies with a PRRSV-1 strain to determine whether the effects we observed in this study are conserved with the other PRRSV genotype. Studies in vivo will help determine whether and how these effects may translate into clinical benefits. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
