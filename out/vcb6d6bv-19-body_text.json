From the partition point of view, this abundance is difficult to explain. However, the presence of Lys in pore forming peptides has been extensively documented [64] [65] [66] and, most likely, it is key for class II viroporins function. This discrepancy in Lys residue content between class II and I viroporins may, once more, highlight differences in the mechanism of action and/or the type of pore that is formed by each viroporin class. While most class I viroporins form highly regulated ion channels (see the influenza M2 example below), class II are thought to disrupt membrane permeability by creating proteolipidic pores similar to those formed by melittin or pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax [67] . Notably, HCV p7, the only class II viroporin with a demonstrated co-translational insertion does not contain any Lys residue in its hydrophobic regions; furthermore, it is thought to form an ion channel like class I IAV M2 [8, 68, 69] . HCV p7 might constitute an exception within class II due to its mechanism of action/insertion or, alternatively, within class I due to the number, length and hydrophobicity profile of its TM regions. Consequently, the presence/absence of Lys residues may indicate not only a difference in the type of pore constructed but also distinct route of insertion into the membrane. In fact, these two features seem to be related. Figures 1 and 2) . Viroporin hydrophobic regions were analyzed jointly (darkest blue) and separately by class (lighter blues).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
