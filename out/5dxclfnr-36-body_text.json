Remarkably, both the raptor complex (mTORC1) and the rictor complex (mTORC2) can mediate an inhibitory phosphorylation of 4E-BP and a stimulatory phosphorylation of p70S6K. This indicates that upon HCMV infection the substrate specificity of rictor and raptor is modified, correlating with a beneficial rictor-mediated Akt activation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
