We have previously established that our methods isolate three clearly distinguished populations that respond to TMEV infection: CD45 hi CD11b + Gr1 ++ 1A8 − inflammatory monocytes, CD45 hi CD11b ++ Gr1 + 1A8 + neutrophils, and CD45 mid CD11b mid Gr1 − 1A8 − microglia [4] . In wildtype mice at 18 hpi, we observed robust populations of all three cell types (Fig. 3a, c) , with inflammatory monocytes making up about 25% of the total CD45 + population (Fig. 3e) . In the absence of CCR2 expression, there was marked suppression of inflammatory monocyte infiltration and a relative increase in neutrophil recruitment, with no change in microglia (Fig. 3b, d) . Indeed, inflammatory monocytes were reduced to less than 3% of total CD45 + cells (WT vs CCR2ko, P = 0.0004 by Dunnett's method; Fig. 3e ). We conclude that the CCR2 receptor axis is the primary driver for inflammatory monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
