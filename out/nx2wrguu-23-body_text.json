Assuming that the incubation period was independently and identically distributed, our mathematical model was formulated using the convolution of infection probability, u t , and distribution of the incubation period, f s . We let t e be the date of exposure and t s be the date of illness onset. Unknown parameters θn = {μ lP , σ lP , μ Trans , σ Trans , R 1 , R 2 , . . ., R n−1 , ε 1 , ε 2 } were estimated using a maximum likelihood method. The exact number of generations was unknown; thus, we fit three different models with a variable number of generations (i.e., n = 2, 3, and 4 excluding generation 0) and later compared the Akaike information criterion values with a correction for small sample size (AICc) and mean squared error (MSE). We did not consider additional generations, because more generations unrealistically required shorter duration of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). As a sensitivity analysis, we compared models with and without ε 1 and ε 2 , i.e., models in which (i) two effectiveness measures are jointly estimated (i.e., ε 1 6 ¼1 and ε 2 6 ¼1), (ii) only the park closure effect is estimated (ε 1 = 1 and ε 2 6 ¼1), (iii) only mosquito control and public awareness campaigns are factored in (ε 1 6 ¼1 and ε 2 = 1), and (iv) no effect of control measures are taken into account (ε 1 = 1 and ε 2 = 1). To this end, we fixed the generation time distribution, using parameters informed from the best model with ε 1 6 ¼1 and ε 2 6 ¼1 and jointly estimated only R i and these effectiveness parameters, comparing AICc values across different models.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
