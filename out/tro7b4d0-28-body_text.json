For assaying Golgi disruption in cells expressing IBV E or the HD mutants cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixative was quenched with PBS containing 10 mM glycine (PBS/Gly). The cells were permeabilized in 0.5% TX-100 for 3 min and washed in PBS/Gly. Cells were stained with rabbit anti-IBV E (1:1000) and mouse anti-GM130 (1:1000). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000). DNA was stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 mg/ml). All images were collected using an Axioscop microscope (Zeiss) equipped for epifluorescence using an ORCA-03G charge-coupled-device camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). Data analysis was done using iVision software (BioVision Technologies) and Microsoft Excel.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
