Building off of a previous report from Feldan Therapeutics that established the CM18-PTD4 shuttle peptide, the present work details the ability of shuttle variant sequences to perform transduction of macromolecular cargo including enzymes such as Cas9 and Cas12a. The results are encouraging and indeed demonstrate that shuttle-driven genome editing can induce clinically-relevant levels of genome editing in airway epithelia in mice without causing marked short-term toxicity. This paper is well written, the data are clearly presented, and the conclusions are in accordance with the results. This work represents a substantial advance for the field of non-viral macromolecular delivery (especially that of genome editing enzymes), which has great clinical promise.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
