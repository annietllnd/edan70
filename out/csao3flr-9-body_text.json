However, human infections with HPAI H7N9 viruses were reported in February 2017 7, 9 . A multibasic cleavage site motif in viral HA was identified that facilitates HPAI H7N9 virus replication in avian species. To assess the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 against HPAI H7N9, pseudoviruses expressing the HA of three HPAI H7N9 isolates (A/ Guangdong/17SF006/2017, A/Guangdong/Th005/2017, and A/Taiwan/1/2017) and the NA of H7N9-AH were generated. As shown in Fig. 5, HNIgGA6 was capable of neutralizing all three variants with IC 50 values of~85 ng/ ml.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
