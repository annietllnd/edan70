Cashman also showed that HBoV1 was found in stool samples of asymptomatic patients [29] . Allander suggested a model for HBoV infection in which high viral loads are potentially associated with respiratory symptoms, and low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding [3] . In our study, a portion of patients with HBoV1 single detections at low viral load suffered from acute respiratory tract disease. What's more, Schildgen suggested that HBoV may indirectly contribute to the development of some colorectal and lung cancers or may play an active role in cancer by interacting with the host genome [30] . Thus, it is hard to make a conclusion that a portion of HBoV single detections with low copy number is always accompanied by a lack of symptoms. The role of HBoV is sometimes as a passenger and sometimes as a pathogen in acute respiratory tract disease.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
