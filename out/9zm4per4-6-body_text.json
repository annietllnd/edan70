The results suggest that RNA-folding in the cell has evolved strategies that help promote the formation of correct structure. They further suggest the direction we need to pursue to achieve better thermodynamic models of RNA. Finally, polymer-solvent effects are predicted for the first time in computational programs of this kind.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
