An aliquot of each compound was added into the solution containing dihydropyrimidinase (0.8 μM), 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0. The decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of protein was measured at 334.5 nm upon excitation at 279 nm and 25°C with a spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F-2700; Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). At least seven data points were used to calculate each K d . Each data point was an average of 2-3 determinants, and the difference of the determinants was within 10%.
