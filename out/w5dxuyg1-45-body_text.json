The pro-inflammatory effects of IL-12 are usually counteracted by IL-10 which attempts to return the immune response to homeostatic base levels [60] . The IL-12:IL-10 ratio has been used as a measure of the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory states in a number of disease conditions [61] . In our study we found an overall higher hepatic IL-12:IL-10 mRNA ratio in FIP than in healthy FCoV-infected cats. Despite being archetypally pro-inflammatory, at high concentrations IL-12 can inhibit the immune response and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [62, 63] . In contrast to the liver, the mesenteric lymph nodes were previously found to downregulate IL-12 transcription in FIP, with IL-10 levels unaffected [20, 21] . It would appear that neither high IL-12 nor high IL-10 are themselves protective and indeed plasmids encoding IL-12 have been found to enhance susceptibility to disease in FIPV vaccination studies, rather than offering protection as had been predicted [64] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
