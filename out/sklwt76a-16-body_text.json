The reference method yielded species-level identification for 20 isolates, including 4 U. urealyticum and 16 U. parvum, with identical results to the assay described herein. The remaining 11 isolates were speciated by the assay described herein but not by the reference method; they were confirmed to be Ureaplasma species by partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing [14] . All partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were identical to one another and were perfect matches to bases 145,365 through 145,845 of GenBank AF222894.1 International Journal of Bacteriology (U. parvum) and bases 40 through 520 of GenBank L08642.1 (U. urealyticum).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
