RSV is a ubiquitous pathogen causing upper respiratory infections in healthy adults, bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children, exacerbations of disease in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and life-threatening pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. RSV infection increases the responsiveness of airway epithelial cells to subsequent bacterial ligands [31] . RIG-I is responsible for the early recognition of RSV dsRNA (within 12 hours of infection) and TLR3 is important for later responses. TLR3 induction by RSV is mediated by RIG-I-dependent IFN-secreted from infected airway epithelial cells and is mediated by IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) sites in its proximal promoter [74] . Addition of an inhibitor of PKR demonstrated no effect on IL-8 induction following RSV infection but a significant difference following polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly (IC)) treatment, suggesting that PKR does not play a role in primary RSV-induced inflammation but does play a role in poly (IC)-induced secondary inflammation [31] . RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins block IFN signaling by stimulating proteasomal degradation of STAT2 and interfering with the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways, Fig. (1) [75] . RSV also inhibits viral-induced apoptosis [76] . Use of knock-out (KO) mice has shown that TLR2 and TLR6 signaling in leukocytes can activate innate immunity against RSV (by inducing TNF-, IL-6, chemokine (C-C) ligand (CCL) 2/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and CCL5/RANTES) and control viral replication. TLR2/RSV interactions also promote neutrophil migration and DC activation within the lung [77] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
