The disease presents clinically with recurrent fever and signs reflecting the In vitro transcriptome studies have also not shown these classical inflammatory mediators to be significantly altered between feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infected and uninfected cells; however, these have focussed on cell culture experiments using CRFK cells, so may not reflect the complex immune interactions in vivo [14, 15] . Additionally, CRFK cells are not primary immune cells so are unlikely to exhibit the same response. In vitro studies using peritoneal macrophages, a system that is closer to the disease scenario, provided evidence of the importance of TNF-α. FIPV induced TNF-α production in infected cells; as TNF-α can itself upregulate the type II FCoV receptor aminopeptidase N, cells may thus enhance their own infection rate [16, 17] . In turn TNF-α functions as a possible contributor to the lymphocyte apoptosis observed in FIP [18, 19] . Despite this, in natural disease, end stage FIP is associated with only a low increase or in some cases even a decrease in TNF-α transcription in the lymphatic tissues themselves [20, 21] . In conjunction, IL-1β and IL-6 transcription showed no to low increases in the lymphatic tissues in FIP whilst IL-10 and IL-12 decreased or remained unchanged [20, 21] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
