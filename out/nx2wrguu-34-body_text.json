Using the AIC value as the weight, the ensemble estimates of ε 1 and ε 2 following model averaging over different assumed numbers of generations were 0.6 and 0.6, respectively. Despite these reductions, it appeared that the estimated effective reproduction number did not decline below the threshold value of 1 (Fig 4) . However, park closure in combination with the mosquito control and awareness campaigns successfully reduced the reproduction number. The relative reduction in the effective reproduction number owing to the closure of Yoyogi Park was estimated to be 20%-60%, again with a wide confidence interval (Table 2) ; however, the combined effect was estimated to be as large as a 44%-88% reduction in the reproduction number. These findings were robust for the assumed number of generations.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
