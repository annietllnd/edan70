In fact, oxidative stress is believed to activate a range of transcription factors/pathways including Nrf2, NF-κB, AP1, TP53, HIF-1α, HSF1, PPAR-γ, MAPK, FoxO, NOTCH, CREB, SCREB1, SP, β-catenin/Wnt, etc. [186] [187] [188] [189] . Activation of these transcription factors is shown to be associated with the expression of over 500 different genes [186] . They modulate the antioxidant defence network by effecting ROS-generating and antioxidant enzymes, mentioned above, which are critically important for animal adaptation to various stresses. In recent years great attention has been paid to a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, Nuclear factor-erythroid-2-(NF-E2-) and related factor 2 (Nrf2) which will be considered briefly in this section. It is well established that Nrf2 is the redox-sensitive master regulator of oxidative stress-related signalling responsible for the adaptive stress responses [190] . Clearly, Nrf2 has a vital role in adaptation to oxidative stress via induction of the expression of various protective molecules [191] [192] [193] [194] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
