Briefly, donor RNA was generated from linearized pMH54derived transfer vectors described above, and electroporated into FCWF cells infected with interspecies chimeric fMHV coronavirus (an MHV-A59 derivative, in which the ectodomain of the spike protein has been replaced by that of a feline coronavirus, thereby changing host cell tropism). The electroporated FCWF cells were seeded onto a monolayer of LR7 cells. After 24 h of incubation at 37uC, culture supernatant containing progeny viruses was harvested. Genotypes of the recombinant viruses were confirmed after two rounds of plaque purifications. Passage 3 stocks were used in experiments. Generation of MHV-EFLM and MHV-ERLM, containing a firefly or Renilla luciferase expression cassette between the E and the M gene, and MHV-aN, containing a N protein tagged with the a-peptide, has been described before [63, 103] . Construction of FIPV expressing Renilla luciferase was reported previously [79] .Recombinant VSVDG/FLuc-G* pseudovirus was generated as described before [71] . Construction of IAV-WSN pseudovirus expressing Renilla luciferase has also been described previously [73] . Viruses were stored in culture medium, supplemented with 25 mM HEPES or upon sucrose cushion purification in TN buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
