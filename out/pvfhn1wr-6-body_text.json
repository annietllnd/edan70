In 2007, an epidemiological survey conducted in three cities of China (Beijing, Shanghai and Changsha) first employed this term to estimate recognition rates and attitudes to mental illness [25] ; and He and Wang introduced the concept of MHL in a Chinese journal in 2013 [26] . However, some components of MHL, predominantly related to attitudes and knowledge, have been studied in China for many years [27] . For example, a variety of research activities on stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness had been conducted among the Chinese population [11, 28] . Examples of culturally specific beliefs about the causes of mental health problems in traditional Chinese culture include viewing mental illness as a punishment for the misconduct of family members and/or their ancestors, or beliefs that mental disorder are inflicted by a supreme being [29] . To further explore and counter these beliefs and to disseminate scientific knowledge, a number of studies focusing on knowledge about mental health problems have been conducted in China [22, 23, 30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
