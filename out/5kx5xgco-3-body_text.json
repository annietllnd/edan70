A considerable number of these types of exercises in the United States have been published in the academic literature but few findings from exercises that have taken place outside the United States have been published. Some researchers in the United States have tried to solve this gap by publishing the findings of "virtual" internet-based, long distance exercises conducted remotely with international partners [17, 18] . Even less is known from direct experiences with in-country exercises or exercises that span multiple countries in a given region. The results of these types of exercises may be reported directly to exercise participants but often don't make it to the scientific literature. If the results from exercises are published in any systematic way, they often get published in in-house publications for domestic audiences rather than scientific journals with a more global reach. The incentives, financial or otherwise, for researchers to turn these in-house publications into scientific papers are limited. This is a major loss to our knowledge base because countries around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of transnational efforts to complement national efforts to detect and respond to public health threats quickly and effectively [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Exercises provide these countries with a vehicle to collaborate and test their ability to respond to these transnational threats. Exercises also provide these countries with an avenue to build relationships and trust among colleagues across sectors and across borders [24] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
