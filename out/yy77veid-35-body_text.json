We counted all positive epithelial cell types in at least two tissue sections from each mouse. In the large and small airways, we saw no GFP protein delivery to non-epithelial cell types. As described in the Supplemental Information in the section titled "Quantitative cell and tissue morphometry", the numerator was the number of GFP positive cells and the denominator was the total number of cells within the airway region counted.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
