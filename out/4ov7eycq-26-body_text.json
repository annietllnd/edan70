The size of this product is consistent with that of non-glycosylated tetherin, and indeed a tetherin mutant bearing substitutions at the two reported sites of N-linked glycosylation 37 co-migrated with the 23-kDa form. The SGTA-mediated accumulation appears to be specific for tetherin, as CD4, another host protein that is degraded by HIV-1 Vpu 5-7 , is unaffected by SGTA overexpression. We identified domains/residues of SGTA, Vpu and tetherin required for the SGTA-mediated accumulation of the non-glycosylated tetherin species. The glutamine-rich C-terminus of SGTA, membrane-proximal basic residues of Vpu, and the transmembrane domain of tetherin are essential for the accumulation of non-glycosylated tetherin. The partially cytosolic localization of 23-kDa tetherin, SGTA and Vpu suggests the formation of a ternary SGTA-Vpu-tetherin complex. Indeed, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that only non-glycosylated, 23-kDa tetherin, but not the higher-molecular-weight glycosylated forms, co-immunoprecipitated with SGTA in the presence of Vpu.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
