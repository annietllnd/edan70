Accordingly, we compared the virus sequences recovered from the brains of dying and recovering mice (Figure 2A) . However, no specific virus sequence differences were detected in viruses from either the severe or mild disease severity groups (DSG) (Figure 2A) . Furthermore, recovered viruses from either severe or mild DSG exhibited similar mortality patterns to those of the parent JaOArS982 virus ( Figure 2B) . Noticeably, the viruses recovered from severe DSG mice did not induce 100% lethal infection in subsequent mouse virulence tests ( Figure 2B ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
