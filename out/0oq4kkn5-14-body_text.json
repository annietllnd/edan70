The maleoyl-diamide 15 was fully inactive. Further enhancement of the inactivation was accomplished by trans-vinyl sulfone 20 displaying the maximal inactivation rate of 1,008 M À 1 s À 1 . Broad-spectrum inhibitors of viral 3C proteases. Three of the most potent inhibitors of CBV 3C protease derived of the S1-binding amino-pyrazolone fragment 2, maleoyl ester 12, maleoyl-diamide 14 and vinyl sulfone 20 were tested towards a panel of six additional rhinoviral and enteroviral 3C proteases, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV-1), human rhinovirus A49 (HRV-A49), human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), Aichi virus 1 (AiV-1), porcine sapelovirus 1 (PSV-1) and human enterovirus B93 (EV-B93) at protein inhibitor stoichiometries of 1:1 and 1:3 (Fig. 5) . Inhibitors 12 and 20 under these conditions strongly reduced the activity of all six proteases investigated, with 20 being generally more potent than 12. All compounds, 12, 14 and 20, showed the highest inhibition for EV-B93 and both 14 and 20 fully inhibited the enzyme even at one inhibitor equivalent. For 12 and 14, the inhibitory activity decreased for EV-B934PSV-14ERBV-14AiV-14EV-D684HRV-A49.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
