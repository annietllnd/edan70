The success rate for designing overlapping coding schemes for the 44 viral proteins considered here was remarkably high: almost 45% of the considered pairs gave designs with E-values better than 10 âˆ’15 vs. the natural proteins. It could be of interest to test whether the modern genetic code is especially tolerant of overlapping genes, compared to ancestral codes (including competing codes that did not survive), or artificial codes (including codes that use larger or smaller amino acid alphabets or codons of a different length). This could be tested by repeating our calculations using one or more alternative codes and comparing the level of success obtained to the values reported above. Such comparisons could help determine whether a high tolerance for overlapping coding schemes played a role in the selection of the genetic code.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
