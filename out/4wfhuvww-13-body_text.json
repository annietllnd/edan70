For instance, in monogenetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, where frameshift mutations result in premature translation termination, the deliberate induction of frameshifting may overcome the problem by skipping the affected sites (Aurino and Nigro, 2006) . It has been noted that aminoglycosides such as gentamicin can enhance frameshifting and stop codon read-through. Gentamicin-induced read-through of stop codons has been evaluated as a treatment option for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (Malik et al., 2010) . While the authors conclude from this phase I clinical trial that gentamicin may not be a good treatment option, they note that other read-through agents may have benefits. A phase I/II clinical trial using a morpholino oligomer (AVI-4658) to correct a frameshift mutation in the dystrophin gene has been completed with the conclusion that AVI-4658 was well tolerated and had significant benefit in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (Cirak et al., 2011) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
