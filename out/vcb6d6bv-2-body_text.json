This seminal work, and many others that followed, established the idea of viroporins as a protein family [2] . Viroporins play a key role in the virus life cycle; deletion of a viroporin-encoding gene from a viral genome drastically diminishes viral fitness. In fact, viroporins have been successfully exploited as therapeutical targets [3, 4] , with the influenza matrix 2 (M2) protein being the most prosperous example. The M2 channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine have been extensively used clinically [5] , and nowadays, regardless of their current restricted use due to the emergence of resistant viruses, M2 inhibitors are still considered a promising target for anti-influenza drug discovery [6] . Furthermore, influenza A viruses lacking the M2 protein are being investigated as live attenuated influenza vaccines [7] . Besides their ability to permeabilize membranes, viroporins share other structural and functional features. They are small proteins, ranging approximately from 6 to 12 kDa, with an elevated Î±-helical content. Another common feature among viroporins is their elevated hydrophobicity; in fact, all viroporins described to date are considered integral membrane proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
