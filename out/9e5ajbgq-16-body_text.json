Categorical variables were described as counts and percentages, whereas means and standard deviations (SD) were computed for continuous variables. The 95% confidence intervals for proportions were constructed using Clopper-Pearson exact tests. The independence of characteristics of study sample by caries status (presence or absence) was assessed using Pearson's chi-squared test (or Fisher's exact tests for smaller samples) and p values. Missing data were analyzed as a separate category (unknown or other) in corresponding variables.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
