This observation indicates that the dissociation and association of the complex is a rapid event [30] and the exact molar mass of the complex cannot be accurately estimated. The broad range of observed molecular weight by AUC (17.8 to 49.7 kDa, Table 3 ) is similar to that seen in the SEC-MALS experiment. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a K d value of 2.4 Î¼M for the complex (Table 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
