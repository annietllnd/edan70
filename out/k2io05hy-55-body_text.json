The inability of BTV NS4 to protect dsRNA from cleavage by endoribonucleases of the RNAse III family and its inability to bind dsRNA in a platebased colorimetric assay are in agreement with sequence analyses that failed to detect a dsRNA binding domain in its aa sequence [18] . Other reoviruses dsRNA-binding proteins include Sigma 3 of mammalian orthoreovirus (found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus), and pns10 of rice dwarf virus [54, 55] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
