Three weeks after challenge, commencing on Blood samples collected from each animal were stored overnight in a refrigerator and then centrifuged the following day at approximately 3000 rpm for approximately 15 minutes, as per site standard operating procedures. Following centrifugation, serum was harvested from each tube and divided into two aliquots, labelled and stored frozen in cryogenic tubes at ≤ -70°C. Blood and serum samples were collected and individually labelled. One of the two aliquots of serum was despatched to a Contract Research Laboratory and analysed for FeLV p27-antigen (PetChek FeLV Antigen Test Kit, IDEXX) as per the test kit instructions, with further confirmatory analysis performed on highly positive samples. This assay uses commercial proprietary technology but has a published relative sensitivity of 98.6% and relative specificity of 98.2%. The presence of gp70 antibodies was evaluated by ELISA according to the test kit instructions (FeLV gp70 Antibody ELISA, European Veterinary Laboratory) and anti-FOCMA antibodies were evaluated by IFA according to the analytical laboratory standard operating procedures. For the gp70 antibody ELISA a titre greater than 90 was considered positive while for anti-FOCMA antibodies a titre greater than 20 was considered positive. All assays were validated by the analytical laboratory prior to use in these studies according to their standard operating procedures and in conjunction with Pfizer Animal Health.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
