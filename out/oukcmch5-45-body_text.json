Briefly, cells were preloaded with FDG substrate by incubation of adherent target cells with 2.5% FBS, 100 mM FDG, 50% PBS at room temperature. After 3 min incubation an excess of 5% FBS in PBS was added, supernatant removed and replaced by growth medium. After a recovery period of 30 min at 37uC, cells were (mock) treated with the different inhibitors for 30 min. MHV-aN virus was bound to cells in DMEM with 2%FCS (in the absence or presence of inhibitors) at a MOI = 20 for 90 min at 4uC to synchronize infection, after which cells were shifted to 37uC for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized and transferred to Eppendorf tubes, washed and immediately analyzed by FACS. For experiments with protease inhibitors the cells were loaded with FDG by hypotonic shock after trypsination and collection of the cells. In this case, FDG loaded cells were incubated on ice for 14 h before being analyzed by FACS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
