To clarify whether the rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs can induce host general transcription suppression, 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs at a m.o.i of 3, and nascent RNA was labeled with 5-ethynyluridine (EU) [61] , a uridine analog, from 12 to 13 hpi. As a control for transcriptional suppression, mock-infected cells were incubated with actinomycin D (ActD) (5 mg/ml) concurrently with the EU treatment. The incorporated EU was covalently linked to azide conjugated with AlexaFluor 647, and cells were further stained with anti-RVFV antibody to detect expression of viral proteins [29] . Then, the level of EU-incorporation and expression of viral proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 4B depicts the level of EU incorporation of the anti-RVFV negative population (mock and ActD) and anti-RVFV positive population (MP-12, rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs infected cells) as a histogram where the RNA fluorescence intensity (EU incorporation) is plotted on the x-axis and the cell count is plotted on the y-axis. These data suggest that MP-12 and rMP12-PTNSs are able to suppress host transcription, whereas rMP12-SFSNSs has no negative effect on host RNA synthesis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
