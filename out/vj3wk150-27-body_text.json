The SARS-CoV spike protein also activates the protein kinase C epsilon, which induces JNK phosphorylation in a calcium-independent manner. Moreover, induction of IL-8, activation of CREB and the transcription of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene in cells transfected with SARS-CoV spike also requires JNK [76, 77] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
