The variable "Round" was forced into the model to account for temporal variation in sampling. The CAR model based on these variables had a DIC value of 1,984.31 (H5N1). Inclusion of the spatial random effect "province" improved the fit of the H5N1 model by 8.17%, reducing the DIC to, 1,822.10. Three of the six variables retained in the model were statistically significant, three variables were not deemed significant, due to the odds ratio (OR) 95% credible interval crossing 1. The odds of a market day being positive for H5N1 varied between Rounds. Comparison of OR across months identified the likelihood of market day status being positive to be highest in January and February. The odds of a market day being positive for H5N1 were 3.36 (95% CrI 1. 29, 8.36) greater where the average maximum temperature was ≥30.33°C compared with areas where the average maximum temperature was ≤24.47°C ( Table 4 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
