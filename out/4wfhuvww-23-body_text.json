The authors have developed a specialized RNAfolding program called pknotsRG-fs that compares the minimal free energy of an enforced pseudoknot structure to that of a freely folded structure such as that given by RNAfold. The spacer region after the common slippery sequence X XXY YYZ is between 1 and 12 nt long. (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/knotinframe) PRFdb (http://prfdb/umd.edu/) is limited to −1 frameshifting in eukaryotes only. Again, the prediction if based on the presence of a heptameric slippery sequence in combination with a pseudoknot (Jacobs et al., 2007) . The slippery sequence is modeled with a 1-8 nt spacer, and the pseudoknot is identified using RNAMotif. The pseudoknot is then further confirmed with other secondary RNA-structure-prediction tools, including Pknots (Rivas and Eddy, 1999) , Nupack (Dirks and Pierce, 2004) , and HotKnots (Ren et al., 2005) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
