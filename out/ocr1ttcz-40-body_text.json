Negative-staining electron microscopy of purified VLPs and ZIKV was performed as described previously. Briefly, 20 Âµl of VLP or ZIKV suspension was fixed in copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc.) and negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate. Virus particles were visualized by using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 80 kV at the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University. Images were captured on a MegaView III side-mounted charge-coupled-device camera (Soft Imaging System, Lakewood, CO), and figures were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
