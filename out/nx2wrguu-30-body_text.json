We let H(θ � ) be the Hessian matrix for estimated values θ � . The 100 sets of parametric bootstrap samples were generated from the multivariate normal distribution with the mean and covariance, the latter of which was obtained with diag(H -1 (θ � )). Simulating 100 times, 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values of the resampled distribution were used to calculate the 95% CI.
