In the pan-microbial microarrays, many probes are designed for one pathogen, and there is no way to confirm each probe. However, the majority of the probes targeting an expected pathogen are likely to be positive, and not hybridize with other non-target microbes. We applied a hypergeometric distribution to calculate a p-value for each species as an assessment of statistical significance. Whether a pathogen was significantly present was determined using a complex interpretation method. The formula of hypergeometric distribution function is as follows:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
