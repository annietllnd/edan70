Therefore, HeLa-mCC1a-DM15 cells were transfected with each of three different siRNAs per gene for 72 h, after which they were infected with wild type (MHV-EFLM) or mutant (MHV-S29FCS) S protein containing MHV. At 7 hpi the cells were lysed and viralreplication dependent luciferase expression levels were determined. As found previously (Fig. 1) , infection with wild type S protein carrying MHV was reduced after gene silencing of RAB5, RAB7, VPS11, and VPS41 (Figure 9, red bars) . On the other hand, infection with MHV-S29FCS was significantly diminished by downregulation of the early endosomal proteins RAB5B and RAB5C, but not of the late endosomal proteins RAB7A and RAB7B or the HOPS complex components VPS11 and VPS41 (Figure 9 , blue bars). Consistently, infections with MHV carrying wild type or mutant S protein were equally blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas the virus with the mutant S (MHV-S29FCS) was much less sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal maturation, including BafA1, or to perturbants of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure S10 in Text S1). From these results we conclude that introduction of a FCS immediately upstream of the FP abolishes the requirement for trafficking of virions to lysosomes and for processing by lysosomal proteases. The resulting virus, which still depends on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, now requires furin cleavage for efficient entry, the enzymes for which occur earlier in the endocytic pathway [78] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
