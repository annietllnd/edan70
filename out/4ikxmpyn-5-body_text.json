Several viruses, such as IAV and West Nile virus (WNV), tend to induce an appropriate and early phase activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. As a result, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibits viral replication and reduces mortality in mouse models (4, 5) . The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by sensing viral components as well as cytosolic danger signals, such as mitochondria injury, protein aggregates, and aberrant ion concentrations, all of which can be caused by a viral infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
