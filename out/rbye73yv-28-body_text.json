Compared with the protein-only regimen, the combination of DNA and protein induced a more functionally diverse antibody repertoire and stronger Th1 immune response. It was suggested that the native S glycoprotein conformation, formed on the cell surface after DNA vaccination, helped induce more diverse antibodies against MERS-CoV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
