Each component involves processes needed to successfully achieve programme transformation. The tool identifies both activities and policies requirements. Further, as a guide with assessment criteria, the road map can be used to measure progress and help identify technical, agencies and policy hurdles and opportunities to achieve an operationalized One Health end point. The transformation would not necessarily proceed in a linear manner and would build on existing programs and activities, incrementally advancing to a fully integrated regional One Health approach (see Table II ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
