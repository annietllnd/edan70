We suspected that effect of viral particle on IFITM1 expression was generated inside the cells. Then we located viral particles using immunofluorescence. Cells were inoculated with viral particles at a MOI of 5 and incubated for 1 h. According to previous description [27, 42] , viral particles were labeled with anti-NP antibody A-3 and FITC conjugated secondary antibody at 8 h after inoculation. Results showed that NP-positive cells were observed after inoculation with viral particles (Fig. 5) . The results indicated that the cellular interaction between intracellular molecules and viral particles might be involved in the induction of IFITM1 expression in HUVECs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
