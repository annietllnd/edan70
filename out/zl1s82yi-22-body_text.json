Briefly, for MS2 rRT-PCR, 5 ml of RNA was added to the AgPath Mastermix (Ambion, Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, California), which contained the published concentrations of primers and probes and 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine succinimidyl ester (ROX) as an internal reference dye, whereas 8 ml of RNA was added for all enterovirus rRT-PCR assays. rRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 30 min at 48uC, 10 min at 95uC, and 60 cycles of 15 s at 95uC and 1 min at 60uC. RNAs extracted from the same stool suspension by the four procedures were assayed on the same rRT-PCR run to minimize analytical differences [19] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
