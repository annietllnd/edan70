Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, CCL-34, ATCC) were used for plaque assay. These cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/mL of penicillin G and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The cells in passages 5~8 were seeded into six-well plates and cultured for 24 h before each experiment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
