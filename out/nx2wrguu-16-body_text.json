In this model, we assumed that the epidemiological dynamics described by the generation-dependent model are what is expected in the absence of interventions. We defined the unobserved index case as generation 0. The index case produces generation 1, and the size of generation 1 is R 0 cases with the relative timing of infection following g t (i.e., following the infection time of the index case, there would be R 0 g t cases on day t). Subsequently, generation 1 produces R 1 cases of generation 2, where R 1 is the reproduction number of generation 1, and there would be R 0 R 1 (g � g) t cases as a function of time since index case t, where � is the convolution operator. If there are only two generations (excluding generation zero), the expected value of the incidence at t days since infection in the index case is R 0 g t + R 0 R 1 (g � g) t . Continuing this procedure through generation 4, and normalizing the quantity by the cumulative number of cases, we obtain the probability density function of infection, h(t), as", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
