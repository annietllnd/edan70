Adenoviruses and HSV-1, both containing a double-stranded DNA genome, seem to manipulate mRNA splicing in favor of viral gene expression and replication. Both viruses do so via hypophosphorylation of particularly two SR proteins, SRSF1, SRSF9 (Adenovirus) and SRSF3, SRSF5 (HSV-1), by modifying either PP2A or SRPK1activity [46, 47] (Figure 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
