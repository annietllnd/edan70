E protein was detectable in rVSV-prM-E at 12 h postinfection, reached the highest expression level at 24 h postinfection, and declined by 36 h primarily because cells were lysed by this time point as indicated by the reduction in β-actin. Recombinant rVSV-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay in E protein expression. E protein was detectable at 24 h and reached its highest level at 36 h post-infection, without cell death as indicated by a continued high level of β-actin. E protein was not detectable in cells infected by rVSV-E even at the time when most cells were lysed. The expression of E protein by rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 but not by rVSV-E in virus-infected cells was confirmed by [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine metabolic labeling ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
