The median levels of the HBoV1 DNA genome in the respiratory samples were higher in the patients with a single HBoV1 detection than in the patients with a mixed respiratory viral infection with HBoV1 (1.95 × 10 6 copies/mL vs. 3.3 × 10 5 copies/mL, P = 0.195) (Figure 3 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
