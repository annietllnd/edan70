The staining was then applied to a selection of cases (five cats from Group 1.1a, all four cats from Group 1.1b, all cats from Group 1.3) from the liver study (1) . Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded liver sections (3-5 Âµm) were subjected to immunohistological staining following the previously published peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) method [3] , with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen and Papanicolaou's haematoxylin counterstaining. Sections incubated with rabbit pre-immune serum and/or PBS instead of the primary antibody, and sections incubated with antibodies blocked by the respective peptide served as negative controls. These did not yield any reaction. Stained liver sections were assessed independently by two pathologists (AJM and AK) and staining was graded in a semi-quantitative For the heart study (2), formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded sections from the left and right ventricular free wall and atrium and from the interventricular septum were stained for IL-6, using the commercial IL-6 antibody (see above; the custom-made antibodies were no longer available at this time). Briefly, protocols were as follows: pre-treatment with citrate buffer followed by 15 min serum block, incubation with primary antibody (diluted 1:500 in dilution buffer (Dako, Basel, Switzerland; S2022) at room temperature for 1 h, use of the EnVision Mouse (Dako Cytomation) detection system. Chromogen, counterstaining methods, and controls were as described above.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
