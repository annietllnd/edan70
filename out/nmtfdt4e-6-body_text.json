From these, additional associations such as new records, ecosystem services, possible pathogen carriers and their lifestyle were added from available literature for forest regeneration impacts, influence towards agriculture activities, trophic level and food web constructs, natural pest control, precursor for diseases, conservation assert (if needed) as well as their geographical tolerance and adaptations ( Table 2 ). Chiropteran morphometric measurements are translated into weight-length data to scale their health in the wild (Table 3) . These indicate food resources, its availability and its adaptation to forest fragmentations. The data is also interpret using Mathematical equations (Shannon, Simpson, Eveness, Margalef and Menhinick) to derive diversity and species richness values which are useful for chiropteran interpolations and assessments within a geographical boundary (Table 4 ).
