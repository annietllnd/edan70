HEK293T, MDCK and Vero cells were used to propagate pseudotyped VSVDG/Luc-G*, Renilla luciferase expressing influenza A pseudovirus, or MERS-CoV, respectively, as described previously [71, 73, 99] . Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Lonza), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa-ATCC cells stably expressing murine CEACAM1a (HeLa-mCC1a) and LR7 cells were used for infection experiments with MHV. HeLa-mCC1a cells stably expressing the deficient bgalactosidase DM15 (HeLa-mCC1a-DM15) were used in the fusion assay. Stable cell lines were generated using a Moloney murine leukemia (MLV) retroviral vector. MLV was produced in HEK293T cells by triple plasmid transfection of a transfer vector containing the DM15 or mCC1a gene as well as a puromycin or neomycin resistance marker gene, respectively, in combination with expression vectors encoding the MLV Gag-Pol, and the VSV spike protein G. Upon MLV transduction, stably transduced cells were selected at 2 mg/ml puromycin and/or 0.5 mg/ml G418 (both Sigma), maintenance at 1 mg/ml puromycin and/or 0.5 mg/ml G418 in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS. HAP1 cells and the VPS33A knockout derivative thereof (H1-DV33) have been described previously [74] . H1-DV33 cells were stably transfected with FLAG-tagged VPS33A (H1-DV33-fV33) using MLV transduction as described above using a blasticidin resistance marker gene in the transfer vector. Stably transduced cells were selected and maintained at 5 mg/ml blasticidin. HAP1 cells and its derivatives were also provided with mCC1 as described above to allow infection of these cells with MHV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
