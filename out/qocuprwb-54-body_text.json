Thus, we discriminated severe and mild cases of mice by their weight ratio at 13 days pi. Using this simple and effective approach, we had previously shown that specific immune responses were detected in severe disease cases when compared with mild cases following TBEV infection [48] . Loss of appetite probably caused the weight loss due to decreased food and water intake. However, undernourishment did not appear to be the simple cause of death, because our preliminary data showed that an infusion of glucose solution to compensate for weight loss did not prevent fatal disease.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
