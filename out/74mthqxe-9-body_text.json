To examine if IFN blocks viral entry, we treated 293 or HTX cells with IFN-a2b, a subclass of type I IFN, and examined its effect on pseudoviral infections. We observed that IFN-a2b significantly inhibited infection of 293 cells by JSRV, VSV and IAV pseudovirions ( Fig. 1E ; p,0.01; data not shown for HTX cells). Interestingly, entry of 10A1 MLV was also slightly but consistently blocked by the IFN-a2b treatment ( Fig. 1E ; p,0.05), similar to previous reports [13, 36] . The greater inhibitory effect of IFN on IAV and VSV entry into 293 cells (Fig. 1E ) relative to that of overexpressing individual IFITM proteins (Fig. 1B) was unexpect-ed because IFITM proteins had higher levels when overexpressed than when induced by IFN (Fig. S2 ). Perhaps IFITMs induced by IFN synergistically cooperated to inhibit viral entry; additionally, ISGs other than IFITMs might have contributed to the observed effects of IFN treatment in 293 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed for the doses of IFN applied during the viral infection period.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
