Proteolytic cleavage of ATF6 into its active form cannot be detected in cells infected with SARS-CoV [38] . Similarly, ATF6 reporter constructs co-transfected with the SARS-CoV spike protein showed minimal reporter production [21] . In contrast, ATF6 cleavage is observed by MHV infection, although both the full-length and the cleaved form of ATF6 decreased significantly at late stage of infection due to sustained translational attenuation [36] . Subsequently, neither the induction of downstream UPR genes nor the activation of the ERSE reporter construct could be detected. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV 8ab protein binds to ATF6 in vitro and promotes its cleavage in the co-transfected cells [25] . However, further experiments using recombinant viruses are required.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
