There was no significant difference in ELISA (Fig. 2g ) or neutralizing antibody titer (Fig. 2h ) at week 5 between these two groups (P > 0.05). No ZIKV specific antibody was detected in DMEM, rVSV-G1670A or rVSV-G1670A-E groups. Compared to the wild-type rVSV backbone, mtdVSV-based viruses had a delayed antibody response (compare Fig. 1f, Fig. 2g ), reflecting the significant more attenuation of these recombinant viruses. In addition, all mice in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group developed NS1-specific antibody as detected by ELISA at week rVSV-prM-E rVSV-prM-E-NS1 r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A -E r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A -a E r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A -a E r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A -p r M -E r V S V -G 1 6 7 0 A -p r M -E r V S V -G 1 6 (Fig. 2i) .
