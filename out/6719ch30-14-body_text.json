Post hoc power analysis was performed for all experiments, and significance was only considered when power ≥ 0.8. Statistical analyses were performed in JMP Pro 12 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Normality was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test and normally distributed data were checked for equal variance. Parametric tests were only applied to data that were both normally distributed and of equal variance. Dunnett's method for pairwise comparison was used for all post hoc sequential comparisons following one-way ANOVA; the Tukey-Kramer test was used for two-way ANOVA pairwise comparisons. Error bars in all graphs are 95% confidence intervals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
