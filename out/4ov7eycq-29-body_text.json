The full-length, infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 58 and the Vpu-defective counterpart NL4-3delVpu 2 have been described previously. The codon-optimized Vpu expression plasmid pcDNA-Vphu was used to express the Vpu 59 . pNL4-3delVpu and pcDNA-Vphu were kindly provided by K. Strebel. The N-terminally HA epitope-tagged tetherin expression vector, the deletion mutants of human tetherin delCT and delGPI, tetherin from African green monkey (agm), and chimeric human tetherin with agm transmembrane domain (Hu-Agm) were described previously 8, 11 , and were generously provided by P. Bieniasz. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to introduce Ala substitutions at three cysteines (C53, C63, C91; referred to as CCC) and two asparagines (N65, N92), and serine, threonine and serine (S2,T3,S4 referred as 2STS), two lysines (K17, K20), and, in combination, serine, threonine and lysine (STSKK) residues in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin. Anti-HA, anti-FLAG and anti-tubulin antibodies, anti-HA conjugated agarose beads, and kifunensine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Anti-human transferrin receptor antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and anti-CD4 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). Anti-calnexin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Zenon antibody labeling kits and the Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody were from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Anti-SGTA and anti-Bag6 antibodies were raised in rabbit 33 . Anti-Vpu 40 , anti-tetherin, and anti-HIV-1 Ig were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
