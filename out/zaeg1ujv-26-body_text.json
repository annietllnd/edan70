In both cases, viroplasm formation and virus replication were not rescued ( Fig. 9C to E) . Interestingly, apparently normal round structures were observed in MA-Δ3 cells, which, however, recruited significantly less VP6 ( Fig. 9C and D) . In addition, the previously observed VP6 spiky structures were not detected in these cells ( Fig. 9C and D) . Similar results were obtained with the rRV-NSP5/KO virus strain, which in MA-Δ3 cells did not replicate and also showed spherical structures that contained NSP5 and NSP2 but not VP6 (Fig. 10A to C) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
