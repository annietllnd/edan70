As seen in previous literature, the mean cost in each milk allotment has less variation than when looking at the range of projected costs per management scenario. This can be attributed to variation in health and mortality rates. Increasing the mortality rate and disease prevalence increased the cost for the remaining calves by spreading infrastructure costs, the loss of the calf and incurred expenses, and additional illness treatments over fewer calves. Variation in costs is not always related to efficiency on-farm but instead related to trade-offs in management styles.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
