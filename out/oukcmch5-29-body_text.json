To test this prediction, Huh-7 cells were pretreated with FI or the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor CPI for 30 min. Cells were subsequently inoculated with MERS-CoV at a MOI of 0.1 in the presence of these inhibitors. At 8 hpi the cells were fixed and the number of infected cells determined using immunocytochemistry and wide-field microscopy. The results indicate that, in contrast to wild type MHV and FIPV, but similarly to recombinant MHV carrying a FCS immediately upstream of the FP, infection with MERS-CoV is strongly inhibited by the FI but not by CPI (Figure 11 ), indicating that MERS-CoV does not require trafficking to lysosomes for efficient entry. Based on these results we conclude that the cleavage site in the CoV S protein immediately upstream of the FP is a key determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
