A wellknown example is that of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptide (60) . The ORF 8b of SARS-CoV forms intracellular aggregates through the valine residue at position 77 (61) . This complex acts as the danger signal to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and lysosomal damage, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
