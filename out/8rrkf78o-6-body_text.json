The plasmid was digested with BamH I/EcoR I to generate fragments of 2.3 kb and 10 kb, while fragments of 0.7 kb and12 kb were generated with EcoR I/Bgl II. Based on the length of these fragments, it was confirmed that the full target fragment (P12A3C) was correctly incorporated into the transfer vector and that the expression cassette was located downstream of polyhedrin promoter. Sequence analysis indicated that the P12A3C was 3,024 bp containing full P1-2A and 3C genes and partial 2B,3B genes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
