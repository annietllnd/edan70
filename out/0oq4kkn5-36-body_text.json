Crystals were grown by the sittingdrop vapour diffusion method at 20°C by mixing equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3,350, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 6.5. Crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solution comprising mother liquor and 25% glycerol for a few seconds and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline XALOC at the ALBA synchrotron (Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona) ( Table 4 ). Diffraction data were indexed and integrated using XDS 42 , and scaled and merged with SCALA 43 . Structure elucidation and refinement were carried out using the CCP4 suite of programs 44 . The initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER 45 with the previously solved EV-B93 3C structure as search model (PDB code: 3Q3X) 41 . REFMAC 46 was employed for structure refinement and Coot 47 for interpretation of electron density and model building. Geometry restraint information for 14 was generated with SKETCHER within CCP4. For a stereo image of the electron density map of the binding site of the protease-inhibitor complex see Supplementary Fig. 36 . The crystal structure was validated with MolProbity 48 and showed 98.1% of all residues in Ramachandranfavoured and 100.0% in Ramachandran-allowed regions.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
