However, SARS-CoV S can be cleaved in vitro by exogenous trypsin at an equivalent site, and it has been proposed that a similar cleavage event may occur in vivo by trypsin-like proteases during viral entry 27, 28 . Moreover, trypsin cleavage of the SARS-CoV S potentiates S for more efficient membrane fusion 27, 29 . For MERS-CoV S, cleavage at S1/S2 enables more efficient receptor recognition 6 . In addition, coronaviruses possess a secondary cleavage site in S2 called S2′ 27 . This site is thought to be cleaved by host proteases after receptor recognition [4] [5] [6] and liberates the viral fusion peptide to insert into host membranes in a S2 pre-hairpin intermediate 30 . The S2′ cleavage has been proposed to occur after an arginine residue conserved across coronavirus genera (SARS-CoV S Arg797) 31 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
