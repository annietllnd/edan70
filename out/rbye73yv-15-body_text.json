One such mAb LCA60 was isolated from memory B cells of human survivors of MERS-CoV infection and was among the most potent mAbs reported in neutralizing pseudo-and live viruses [53] . More mAbs isolated from human survivors were described as more convalescent blood samples became available, including MCA1 [56] , CDC-C2, CDC-C5, CDC-A2, CDC-A10 [50] , MERS-GD27, and MERS-GD33 [58, 59] (Figure  3 (C)), all with potent neutralizing activities against MERS-CoV. The mAbs LCA60, CDC-C2, MCA1, and MERS-GD27 were also tested to be protective in animal models.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
