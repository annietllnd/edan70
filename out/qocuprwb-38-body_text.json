(B) Weight changes of B6 mice infected with 10 4 pfu of recovered viruses from severe (S14, S15, S18 and S19) and mild (M17 replaced to M4, M10, M13 and M24) cases. Five mice in each group were inoculated subcutaneously and observed for 21 days. Closed and open symbols identify mice that died or survived, respectively, during observation period. mice with JaOArS982, and observed the disease courses compared with those of infected fully immunocompetent B6 mice. Unexpectedly, the mortality rates of TNF-α KO and IL-10 KO mice were increased compared with those of WT mice (77.3%, 43.2% and 26.7%, respectively) ( Figure 5A ). MSTs of fatal cases in TNF-α KO and IL-10 KO mice (12.6 ± 1.05 and 11.5 ± 0.80 days) were significantly shorter than those of WT mice (15.5 ± 2.14 days) (p=0.0087 and p=0.0039, respectively). Consequently, these observations indicate that TNF-α and IL-10 protect significant proportions of mice from fatal infection by pathogenic JaOArS982 virus. Importantly, TNF-α had a particularly pronounced protective effect.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
