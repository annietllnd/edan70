In all cases, a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship was obtained, demonstrating that the channel displayed resistance (ohmic) behavior for both positive and negative potential. These results indicate that the protein 3a IC was neither open nor closed at specific electric potentials.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
