Recently Overend and co-workers showed that Mx1 expression by infected PAMs was generally correlated with IFNÎ² production [44] . Additionally, recent studies focused on the possibility to use of Mx1 gene as a potential DNA marker for PRRS resistance in pigs [45] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
