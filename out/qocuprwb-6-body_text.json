In common with human cases, mice develop relatively similar neurological dysfunction and the pathologic changes in infected mouse brains are similar to those observed in human cases [6, 9] . Although extraneural infection frequently does not result in detectable viremia or virus burden in mice, it is believed that initial virus replication occurs in dendritic cells (DCs) such as Langerhans cells at the site of infection, and the infected DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes [6] . Virus then invades the CNS and hosts develop CNS disease, although the mechanism by which the blood-brain-barrier is crossed is not completely understood [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
