Effective vaccination program, client education, and disinfection strategies will help in reducing the incidence. C. difficile is identified to be a common enteropathogen in diarrheic as well as healthy puppies, yet its role in pathogenesis is not clearly understood. Various bacteria and the toxins also play an important role as a sole enteropathogen and in combination with viruses in the etiology of HGE in puppies. Gentamicin is found to have the maximum sensitivity pattern against the enteropathogens implicated in severe HGE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
