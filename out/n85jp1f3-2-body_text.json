One prominent example was the yellow fever experiments conducted by Walter Reed and colleagues in the early 1900s that proved that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes [1] . Over the last few decades, controlled human malaria infection studies have enrolled approximately 2000 participants, with no serious adverse events or hospitalizations [2, 3] . Despite many important scientific advances from HCTs on cholera, dengue, influenza, and typhoid, some studies have been highly controversial [4] , or even "ethically impossible," such as the sexually transmitted infection experiments conducted in Guatemala in the 1950s [5] . Prominent ethical guidelines also preclude conducting HCTs on diseases that can cause serious morbidity or mortality and have no proven effective treatment, such as Ebola or Anthrax [6] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
