The infection stress stimili induces translational shut off via the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor α (eIF2α). eIF2α, together with eIF2β, and eIF2γ, forms eIF2, mediates the binding of initiator Met-tRNAi to the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Once the initiation is completed, eIF2-GDP is released from the ribosome, and GDP is exchanged for GTP to form active eIF2-GTP, participating in another round of translation initiation. eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51, which has increased affinity to eIF2β and blocks the exchange of GDP to GTP, thus depleting the active eIF2β-GTP pool. Since the cellular concentration of eIF2β is much lower than eIF2α, a small proportion of phosphor-eIF2α can exhaust eIF2β by sequestration [96] . Therefore, phosphorylation of eIF2α is a checkpoint of protein synthesis initiation and relieves stress through ceasing translation under infection stress. Given the importance of eIF2α in translation initiation, the level of phosphor-eIF2α is no wonder regulated under infection stress. There are four eIF2α kinases, GCN2, HRI, PERK, and PKR. These kinases are activated as a result of discrete stress, such as amino acid starvation or ultraviolet light (GCN2), heme deficiency (HRI), excess unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER [97] , and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced in virus-infected cells (PKR) [98] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
