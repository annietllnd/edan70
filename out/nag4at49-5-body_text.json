Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and PCR reactions were performed with pfuTurbo from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). GPI protein genes were codon optimized for P. pastoris and synthesized by GeneArt AG (Regensburg, Germany). Pichia transformations were conducted using electroporation. Table 1 lists the yeast strains used in this study. All Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris expression strains used were constructed from wild-type Pichia pastoris strain NRRL-Y11430 (Northern Regional Research Laboratories, Peoria, IL) using methods described in [21] [22] [23] [24] . Anti-PCSK9 yeast display mating library construction was described in Chen et al. [25] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
