Intracellular dsRNA consists of the genomes of dsRNA viruses and replicative intermediates of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, and, thus, long dsRNA is known as an RNA virus-specific molecule and molecular marker for RNA virus infection and replication (28) . Therefore, a metagenomic analysis targeting intracellular long dsRNA theoretically retrieves dsRNA and ssRNA viruses, except for ssRNA retroviruses, which do not form dsRNA in the replicative stage. In addition, it is possible to eliminate non-viral nucleic acids such as mRNA and rRNA, which dominate RNA-seq reads, by DNase I, S1 nuclease, RNase, or column chromatography (44) . However, previous studies have reported technical issues with the purification of dsRNA and library construction. Random priming for the reverse transcription of dsRNA does not enable the terminal sequences of the dsRNA molecule to be determined or eliminate significant contamination by non-viral sequences. The heterogeneous sequencing depth in certain viral genome segments is also an issue associated with this method (2, 6, 9, 37) . Although the full-length cDNAs of dsRNA viruses may be obtained using loop primers that are ligated to the dsRNA terminal ends for reverse transcription (8) , this method is only useful for short dsRNA viruses. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this method has not yet been applied to a viral metagenomic analysis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
