Protein extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer 2 (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Each sample was sonicated three times for 20 s each time and centrifuged at 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, the protein present in the supernatant was purified through metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using cobalt resin (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Every fraction from the purification process was analyzed in 12% polyacrylamide gels using Coomassie Blue EZBlue gel staining reagent (Sigma). Then, the obtained protein was desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in PBS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
