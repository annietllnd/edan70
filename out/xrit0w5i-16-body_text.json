According to previous description [40] , HUVECs or BEAS-2Bs were directly fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were labeled with anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibody A-3 (Aviva Systems Biology) overnight, followed by stained with FITC conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ORIGENE) for 1 h at 37°C. The images were captured using OLYMPUS fluorescence microscopy.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
