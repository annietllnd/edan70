In addition to their advantages of improved safety and strong immune response, VLP vaccines can readily substitute HA or NA genes to allow rapid, dynamic responses to a new influenza outbreak [14, 35, 36] . However, efficient construction and production of VLPs are major obstacles to commercialization [37] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
