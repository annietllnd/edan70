Recently, an adaptation of this approach has been developed using fluorophores that are amenable to high-throughput screening applications (Cardno et al., 2009 ). An in vivo adaptation for yeast cells has been proposed for use in high-throughput screening experiments (Harger and Dinman, 2003) . For instance, a random nucleotide sequence can be inserted between the in-frame and the out-of-frame luciferase to determine which sequence will result in high levels of out-of-frame expression. The main advantages of such a system are the broad linear range of the assay, the internal mRNA expression control (luciferase 1), the possibility to normalize relative frameshift expression, and the ease of use. One problem with the approach is that the secondary structure is affected by the length of the sequence inserted in the dual luciferase reporter. Thus, the context of the frameshift motifs needs to be taken into account. Further, the high number of potential nucleotide combinations may outweigh the capacity of even highly automated processes. Even though this will identify putative sequences with high potential for frameshifting, it is still not clear whether the out-of-frame peptides or proteins are stable and functional. Their presence in open reading frames may hint that a frameshift is buried within the gene. Subsequent low-throughput experimental methods (see above) need to be designed to confirm expression of the frameshifted protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
