Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, in Tris buffered saline (TBS: 25 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and incubated over night with a dilution of 1/300 rabbit antisera. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween-20 (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) and further incubated with monoclonal, anti-rabbit, peroxydase conjugate (Sigma), diluted at 1/750 in 5% skimmed milk. After 2 hours the membrane was washed three times with TBS-Tween-20 and developed using 4-chloronaphthol (Sigma) in presence of hydrogen peroxide.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
