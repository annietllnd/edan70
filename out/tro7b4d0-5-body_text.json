{"cord_uid":"tro7b4d0", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC3343006", "divid":3, "text":"The membrane topology of CoV E is of considerable debate. CoV E has a short (,10aa) hydrophilic N-terminus followed by a long hydrophobic domain (,25aa) and a hydrophilic C-terminus. The N-terminus does not contain a canonical ER signal sequence [10] . The hydrophobic domain is unusually long for a protein targeted to the ERGIC/Golgi complex, but does not appear to be long enough to span the lipid bilayer twice [11] . These properties make it difficult to predict the topology based on the primary sequence. Complicating matters is the fact that multiple topologies have been reported in the literature for different CoV E proteins. Both IBV E and SARS-CoV E have been reported to exist as a type III transmembrane protein (N exo , C cyto ) [12, 13] . Other investigators have reported the opposite topology for SARS-CoV E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) E (N cyto , C exo ) [14, 15] . Yet another topology reported for CoV E is a membrane hairpin, where the hydrophobic domain bends into the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane with the N-and C-termini in the cytoplasm. The hairpin topology has been reported for MHV E and SARS-CoV E [15] [16] [17] . These discrepancies suggest that CoV E may adopt more than one membrane topology. If this is the case, CoV E may perform distinct functions depending on how it is inserted into the membrane. For example, a transmembrane version of CoV E could oligomerize and act as an ion channel, whereas a membrane hairpin could drive virion budding.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
