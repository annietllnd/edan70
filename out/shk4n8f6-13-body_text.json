Next, using TEM, we analyzed MW morphology after treatment with siLC3, siATG7 or siATG12. Expression of pTM-NS3-5B in cells treated with siCTL induced heterogeneous membrane alterations composed of DMVs of an average size of 200 nm interspersed by multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 7A,B) and that were not seen in negative cells (Fig. 7E) . Silencing of ATG7 resulted in more homogenous DMVs with a markedly decreased average size (90 nm) and led to the disappearance of MMVs (Fig. 7A,B,D) . Silencing of ATG12 led to a similar effect but with a much lower abundance of DMVs (Fig. 7C) . However, silencing of LC3 had no effect on the DMV size (average diameter 200 nm) (Fig. 7B) or on the vesicle types in which both DMVs and MMVs coexist (Fig. 7C,D) . Thus, a similar morphology of membrane alterations was observed in siCTL-treated cells (Fig. 7A,B) . These results strongly suggest that the ATG5-12 conjugate is crucial for the formation of a typical HCV-induced MW architecture.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
