An A-rich polypurine tract is present upstream of the NS4 ORF in all of the sequenced Orbivirus species, except the tick borne St. Croix River virus (SCRV, [46] . The SCRV NS4-ORF (nt 101-379) is interrupted by a stop codon at position 217. Although hydrophobicity profiles of putative NS4 proteins from BTV, AHSV, PHSV, YUOV and GIV as analysed using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm [22] are somewhat variable, overall they show broadly similar patterns of conserved domains, indicating that the NS4 proteins are generally hydrophilic ( figure 24 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
