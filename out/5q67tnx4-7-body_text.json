The poor understanding of what truly constitutes normal versus abnormal, along with the ability to only superficially characterize the gut microbial population, limits understanding of the pathophysiology of enteritis [5] . There is a growing body of evidence indicating bacterial translocation due to impaired gastrointestinal function, leading to the septicemia in young puppies [6] . This supports the use of antibiotics in the treatment protocol of the affected animals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
