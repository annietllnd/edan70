One of the genes which showed a high increase of expression in all three infected groups of animals was CXCL10 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10). Its FC ranged from 10.297 in ILI group, to 12.280 in DAN and 18.799 in BOR group. This gene encodes one of proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 attracting leukocytes to the site of infection [53] . CXCL10 overexpression has been already observed for highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate [54] and other Type 2 strains [55, 56] . Previous studies showed that expression of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1, 6 or tumor necrosis factor during PRRSV infection corresponds to the severity of infection [57] . In presented study the overexpression of CXCL10 reached the highest level in BOR group and remained at a similar level in both DAN and ILI groups, which corresponds with the most severe clinical outcome of infection observed in BOR-infected pigs [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
