Briefly, after perfusion with cold PBS, brains and thymus were removed and placed on ice in RPMI containing 5% FCS (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.). Brains were strained and homogenized gently with a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). After washing with RPMI, the cell suspension was layered onto a 70% and 30% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences AB) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 45 min at 23° C. The leukocytes were collected from between the 70% and 30% interface. Thymocytes and splenocytes were also recovered from these mice. Cells were strained with a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing, cells were resuspended in RPMI medium. Isolated cells were counted and kept on ice until the staining procedure.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
