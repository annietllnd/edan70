CMV-3A was immobilized as ligand on two columns (Fig 3) . After blocking, PBST buffer, CMV antibody and normal serum without CMV antibody were added as blank, positive, and negative controls (respectively) to the first, second, and third rows, respectively. The 0.011-, 0.043-, 0.170-, 0.681-and 2.725-IU/mL samples were added from the fourth to the eighth rows, respectively. Concentration plotted on the X-axis and the variation of the grayscale value compared to blank control was plotted on the Y-axis to generate the calibration curve (Fig 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
