The model is consistent with the experimental data and thermodynamics. The unique features of this model are the mapping, its folding strategy, and its ability to explore the role of polymer swelling and globular structure formation within the context of RNA structure. The approach shows that it is possible to develop a calculation approach that accounts for long range interactions and permits the development of modules to address them. Further, if the time window is seen as a progressive process of updating the 39 end with the new structure, the behavior is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] and the contact order model [26] [27] [28] . Very complex secondary structures can be built if the components of the structure can be explained in terms of some recognizable folding pathway.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
