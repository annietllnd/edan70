PCR was performed using the SuperScriptH III One-Step RT-PCR System with PlatinumH Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cycling conditions for the vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana (VSV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) real-time RT-PCR included a reverse transcription step for 15 min at 55uC, initial denaturation for 2 min at 95uC, and 45 cycles consisting of denaturation for 15 seconds at 95uC and primer annealing/ elongation for 30 seconds at 58uC. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out using the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
