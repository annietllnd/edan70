In this study, cross-intron primers for three different var genes, var2csa (PFL0030c), a group B gene (PFL0935c) and a group C gene (PFD0615c) all showed splicing of exon I to exon II in both the unselected and VAR2CSA-selected NF54 parasites throughout the whole cycle, indicating that these var genes are normally expressed as correctly spliced transcripts ( Figure 4 ). The fact that the transcription levels of the four different var2csa-specific primers were tightly correlated further indicates that the transcripts are not only correctly spliced but also probably full-length at all stages. This is contrary to a conclusion drawn in an earlier study in which a difference between the levels of transcription detected by cross-intron primers and exon I primers of some var genes using Q-RT PCR were reported [38] . This discrepancy could be due to the 'amplification bias' of the cross-intron primers, and the difficulties of designing unique primers targeting the exon II. However it is worth noting that promiscuous transcription in any form is incompatible with transfection experiments showing the exclusive expression of a single var gene regulated at a pre-transcriptional level [33, 34, 39, 40] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
