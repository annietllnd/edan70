The RIPLS was originally formulated in 1999 by Parsell and Bligh [5] as a 19-item questionnaire consisting of 3 subscales (Teamwork and Collaboration; Professional Identity; and Roles and Responsibilities). As the first instrument designed to evaluate the "readiness" of healthcare students for shared activities, the RIPLS allows educators to quantify the impact of interventions on healthcare students [6, 7] . RIPLS has subsequently been proven to be a valid and useful tool for measuring student attitudes towards IPE in the undergraduate context [8] . For each item, participants were asked to provide their response using a Likert scale with 1 representing "Strongly Disagree" and 5 representing "Strongly Agree". The questionnaire was administered twice to all participants -before and after the IPE components of the conference (prior to the plenary session and after the small-group workshops) to determine the effectiveness of the conference in improving students' attitudes towards IPE. Participation in this study was voluntary, with consent taken after provision of a Participation Information Sheet containing details of the study. The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
