The countries of this region include Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (specifically, Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. The region is home to diverse environments and populations of plants, animals and people living in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet. The physical and biological environments are diverse and include temperate rainforest, boreal forest, tundra, polar desert and cold oceans. There are approximately 10 million human inhabitants in the region that are ethnically diverse with dozens of Indigenous groups (1) . Many of these people still have traditional subsistence economies based upon gathering wild plants, hunting fishing and herding of reindeer (2, 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
