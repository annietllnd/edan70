Seven days old MDMs cultivated with or without L929 conditioned medium were treated with HBSS (control) or tulathromycin (1 mg/mL for 12 hours). The murine L929 fibroblast cell line, known to secrete macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is widely used to induce macrophage differentiation from monocytes and prevent differentiation into monocyte-derived dendritic cells [38] . Prior to staining, L929-grown cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold PBS to remove all L929 media and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes. Fixed cells were then washed 3 times in cold PBS and stained for 1 hour with a R-phycoerythrin (RPE) conjugated anti-CD163 antibody (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-CD169 antibody (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at a dilution of 1 to 500 and 1 to 250 respectively. Following staining cells were washed 3 times in cold PBS and observed under Leica DMR fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescence ratios from randomly selected fields were calculated using the software ImageJ. Images were taken with a Retiga 2000x camera. To prevent any bias, slide labelling was covered with tape prior to microscopic observations.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
