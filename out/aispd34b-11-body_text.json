Aliquots of the parasite culture corresponding to 2 × 10 5 infected erythrocytes were labelled by ethidium bromide (to allow exclusion of remaining uninfected erythrocytes). Pools of human sera and rabbit VAR2CSA-specific serum were used for IgG surface-staining of infected erythrocytes. Infected erythrocytes were sequentially exposed to 5 μl pooled human serum, and 1 μl goat anti-human IgG (Vector) in a total volume of 100 μl. For surface staining by rabbit VAR2CSA DBL5ε -specific IgG, samples were sequentially exposed to 20 μl rabbit serum pre-absorbed against uninfected erythrocytes, 1 μl biotinylated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (The Binding Site) and 0.5 μl streptavidin-FITC (BD Pharmingen). All incubations were performed in a total volume of 100 μl PBS with 2% FCS for 30 min. Samples were washed twice with 3 ml PBS with 2% FCS in between each incubation. Data from a minimum of 5,000 infected erythrocytes were acquired using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). A batch of uninfected erythrocytes was analysed to exclude IgG binding to erythrocyte antigens. All samples relating to a particular time point were stained and processed immediately after removal from the 37°C incubator.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
