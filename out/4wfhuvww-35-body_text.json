One could use the dual luciferase reporter construct (Grentzmann et al., 1998) with a known frameshift motif and screen siRNA or cDNA libraries to identify genes that enhance or inhibit the frameshifting efficiency of this reporter. The existence of non-coding RNAs that modulate frameshifting suggests that frameshifting is regulated by endogenous gene products.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
