After denaturing at 95uC for 5 minutes, targets were amplified by 45 cycles of 95uC for 30 seconds, 40uC for 30 seconds, 50uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 90 seconds. The amplified products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Pure water was used as a negative control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
