Sequences GU075704 and JN715833 were identified by preliminary BLAST searches as the closest relatives of the novel Anaplasmataceae species and were included in the ribosomal alignment. Sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW and were manually curated using secondary structure pairing constraints with Bioedit software [31] (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Alignments) to yield, after exclusion of the primer sequences and non-conserved indels, ungapped alignments for 16S rRNA (1,347 bp, N = 26 sequences), groEL (804 bp, N = 23), gltA (720 bp, N = 23) and rpoB (555 bp, N = 19) (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Text). Identity score matrices were generated with Bioedit from the curated alignments (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Data). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the online program suite at www.Phylogeny.fr using the "A la Carte" menu [32] on the curated alignments. Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed as described [33, 34] and edited using TreeDyn [35] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
