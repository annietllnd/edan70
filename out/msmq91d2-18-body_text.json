Those mice were challenged with 1610 3 pfu of wt RVFV ZH501 strain (i.p) at 45 days post vaccination. The challenge experiment was performed at an animal biosafety level 4 facility at the UTMB Shope laboratory. Mice were observed for 21 days after challenge, and the body weight was monitored daily. Sera were collected at 1, 2, 3, and 42 days post vaccination (retro-orbital bleeding), and at 21 days post wt RVFV challenge (cardiac puncture). Survival curves of mice (Kaplan-Meyer method) were analyzed by Graphpad Prism 5.03 program (Graphpad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA.).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
