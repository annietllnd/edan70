The algorithm was tested on 500 Pfam protein domains, 70-100 amino acids long, from 500 Pfam families. Within each family, the first protein was chosen. Each domain was assigned a conservation pattern based on the Pfam seed alignment of its family. Specifically, we assigned to each position i of X a weight p i , inversely proportional to the exponential of the sequence entropy S i of the corresponding column 19 . The entropy was computed not from the amino acid types, but from a simplified classification into six groups: The search algorithm was applied to all 500 × 500 domain pairs, in three possible reading frames. For the frames F = −2 and F = 0, we did two calculations per pair, with the beginning of the shorter protein X′ aligned with either end of Y′. For the frame F = 1, we also did two calculations per pair; the beginning of the two proteins were aligned, and either Y or X was in the F = 1 frame (with the other protein in the F = 0 frame). This led to a total of 751,500 optimization runs. The nucleotide sequences do not include a STOP codon; we assume one can be added (to the shorter protein) by manually changing a few nucleotides.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
