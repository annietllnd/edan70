Clinical samples were all from patients with obvious infectious disease symptoms and which obtained negative results with routine diagnostic methods. Following detection by EOPM, the screened pathogens that caused similar clinical symptoms to those of the patients from which the clinical samples were collected were PCR amplified with species-or genusspecific primers. PCR-positive samples were then sequenced. This study obtained ethical approval from Ethical Committee of Guangdong Women and Children's Hospital. Informed consent was not required because clinical samples were screened for potential pathogens in vitro. Original microarray data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus with the platform access number GPL16935.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
