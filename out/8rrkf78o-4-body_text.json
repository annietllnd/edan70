It can result in great reduction of productivity in adult animals and death in young animals. FMD is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (with sporadic outbreaks in other ''free areas''). In countries affected by the disease, livestock trade and animal products have been impacted. Even in developed countries and areas, outbreak of FMD would greatly affect the economy. In 2001, the outbreak of FMD in England brought a loss of 8 billion dollars [1] , and the consequent occurrence in Holland killed 0.2 million animals [2] . In addition, the 1997 outbreak in Taiwan brought a loss of about 3.6 billion dollars to its exports [3] .
