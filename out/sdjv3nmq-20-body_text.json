Expression levels of these proteins could be quite different in an actual infection. Moreover, interactions between viral proteins could not be recreated using the over-simplified overexpression approach. In two studies, JNK phosphorylation was detected in cells infected with MHV 19 and SARS-CoV 20 . However, activation of upstream kinases and downstream substrates was not determined, leaving the complete pathway largely unexplored.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
