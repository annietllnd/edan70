The next most common topic was suicide (n = 129, including 119 surveys and 10 interventions). Depression, psychosis and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) were the top three disorders for which MHL was assessed (n = 90 for depression, 65 for psychosis and 29 for GAD, respectively). However, other common mental disorders, such as substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, mania or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been less commonly studied. No studies on MHL related to trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were identified, suggesting a gap for future research (Fig. 2d) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
