Currently, the time complexity is approximately O(N 4.7 ) independent of the pseudoknot option. This is because the secondary structure methods have not been optimized. With optimization, the pseudoknot option can achieve a time complexity of approximately O(N 4 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
