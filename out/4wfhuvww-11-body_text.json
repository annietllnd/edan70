Because −1 frameshifting is essential for retroviral gene expression, it has been proposed that chemical interference with frameshifting would be a good anti-viral strategy. Recently, a genome-wide screen to identify regulators of HIV-1 frameshifting has identified eRF1 as an essential host gene required for −1 frameshifting (Kobayashi et al., 2010) , suggesting that eRF1 may be a good therapeutic target in AIDS (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012) . In addition, it has been proposed that HIV frameshifting can be modulated by protein kinase R, as well as by factors that modulate translation efficiency such as rapamycin (Gendron et al., 2008) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
