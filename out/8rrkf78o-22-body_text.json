The target fragments of P1-2A and 3C were inserted into baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393 using BamH I/ EcoR I and EcoR I/Bgl II sites following the routine protocols to generate a transfer plasmid. The whole P1-2A and 3C coding regions in transfer plasmid was sequenced and named pVL-P12A3C.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
