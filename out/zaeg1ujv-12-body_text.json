NSP5 expression and localization to viroplasms in virus-infected cells have been considered essential for virus replication (12, 13, 25, 31) . Previous studies, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting gs11 mRNA, have shown strong impairment of RV replication (12, 13) . In order to investigate the effects of point mutations and deletions within the NSP5 gene, we took advantage of the established transcomplementing MA104 cell line stably expressing NSP5. In addition, we also made two cell lines expressing NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusions, which are rapidly and efficiently recruited into viroplasms upon virus infection (Table 1) (7, 22) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
