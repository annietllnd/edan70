The research has involved a diversity of settings and participants. MHL research into a broader range of mental disorders, such as substance use disorders, bipolar disorder and trauma, are warranted. Interventions targeted to the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, including help seeking and skills to help people who are developing mental health problems, are also needed. Such programs should be evaluated with higherquality study designs, such as controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for MHL measurements should also be addressed in future studies. Findings of this review provides evidence to policy makers, practitioners and consumers, and assists in underpinning future research areas.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
