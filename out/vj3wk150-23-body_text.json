For example, inhibition of p38 significantly reduces the transcription and secretion of IL-6 in MHV-infected cells [67] . Similarly, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 is dependent on p38 activation in IBV-infected cells [63] . Moreover, production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β in FIPV-infected cells is significantly inhibited by p38 inhibitor [62] . Finally, p38 has been demonstrated to induce the expression of macrophage prothrombinase fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2), a protein crucial for the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis in MHV-3-infected mice [60, 68] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
