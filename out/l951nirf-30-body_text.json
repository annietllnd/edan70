Splenocytes from mice immunized with killed vaccine secreted only basal levels of IFN-γ, similar to results obtained in mice injected with PBS (Fig 4) . However, splenocytes from mice immunized with baculoviruses (AcHERV-HA or AcHERV-VLP) secreted 10-to 11-fold more IFN-γ than those from mice immunized with killed vaccine. The comparison between AcHERV-HA group and AcHERV-VLP group showed statistically difference (p = 0.013), and IFN-γ spot number in AcHERV-HA group was 12.8% lower than number in AcHERV-VLP group, which indicates AcHERV-VLP immunization elicits more IFN-γ production than AcHERV-HA immunization. These results support the conclusion that the HERV-encoded, VLP-forming baculovirus system is a strong candidate influenza vaccine with the potential to increase the cellular immune response as well as the humoral immune response.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
