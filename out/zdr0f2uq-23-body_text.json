NS1 exhibits two N-linked glycosylation sites that have been shown, via mutagenesis studies, to be essential for a number of crucial roles, including hexamer formation, facilitating secretion and modulating protein stability [120] . NS1 binds to heparin sulphate and chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycans on the surface of various cells [121] . NS1 has been shown to play a role in both viral replication [122] and immune evasion [123, 124] , and it has been hypothesised that immune recognition of NS1 on endothelial cell surfaces may facilitate vascular leakage during severe Dengue infection [125] . The use of secreted/shed GPs in order to subvert the immune system and/or enhance infectivity appears to be a common phenomenon utilised by viruses. Other examples include the secreted form of respiratory syncytial virus G glycoprotein, which distracts the antibodyimmune response by acting as a decoy [126] , secreted BARF1 and soluble gp42 glycoproteins of Epstein-Barr virus, which interfere with macrophage differentiation and activation, and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation respectively [127, 128] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
