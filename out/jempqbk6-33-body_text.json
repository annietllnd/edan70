All of these structures can be readily superposed using their C-terminal RecA-like domain ( Table 2 and Figure 3F ), a motif which has an architecture shared by helicases S1H and S2H [70] . The grouping of S1H and S2H helicases into a common cluster is in agreement with them putatively sharing a common ancestor [71] . This extends the observed sequence similarity in the helicase C family.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
