The LDLY motif (residues 55-58) essential for binding the HCC is situated in the N-terminal helix (Fig 3B) . Whether the flexibility of this helix is a feature needed for binding the HCC will need to await further investigation. The N-terminal domains of FLASH and Lsm11 form a 2:1 heterotrimer for histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing FLASH NTD mutations can affect Lsm11 NTD binding but not dimerization", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
