The triterpene structure of the HMGB1-binding compound is capable of binding to HMGB1 and altering its proinflammatory properties, inhibiting HMGB1-dependent cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 induction [113] . 18 -glycyrrhetic acid has significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication in vitro, and studies to determine whether 18 -glycyrrhetic acid attenuates rotavirus replication in vivo are underway, although the exact mechanism is unclear. However, some reports show that 18 -glycyrrhetic acid inhibits NF-B activation, which has been interpreted as 18 -glycyrrhetic acidmediated regulation of the inflammatory response [114] . 18glycyrrhetinic acid can also inhibit the activity of tyrosine and prevent melanin growth and whitening. Some reports show that 18 -glycyrrhetinic acid is likely responsible for amelioration of dysfunction of glutamate transport in astrocytes, and the inhibition of protein kinase C activity might be related to its pharmacological efficacy [67] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
