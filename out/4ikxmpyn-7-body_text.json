As an effect factor, caspase-1 mediates the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and the propyroptotic factor gasdermin D (GSDMD) (14) . GSDMD forms pores in the membrane of infected cells, facilitating the secretion of IL-1β/IL-18 and inducing the inflammation-associated cell death known as pyroptosis (15) . The secretion of IL-1β subsequently recruits neutrophils to the inflammatory site to aid in the elimination of invading viruses (16) . Moreover, both IL-1β and IL-18 are responsible for the subsequent induction of the adaptive immune response (17, 18) . Accordingly, optimal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome facilitates the establishment of a host antiviral status.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
