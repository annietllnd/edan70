We have identified 28 additional families that have their representatives in viruses from different Baltimore classes and observe a diverse distribution of hits among diverse Baltimore classes (Supplementary Figure S1 , Supplementary Table S3 ). In a few cases, possible horizontal gene transfer (baculovirus glycoprotein GP64 in Thogotovirus [55] or infectious salmon anemia virus-like hemagglutinin in anguillid herpesvirus 1 [56] ) or common evolution (movement protein family MP [57] ) has previously been discussed. In others, nothing is known (e.g., we have identified the presence of a Corona_NS2 domain in VP3 of rotavirus with a significant e-value of 2.7e-06 for the first time), but the weak sequence similarity does not allow for suggesting a definitive evolutionary scenario.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
