Initial host cell entry is mediated by GPC-mediated attachment to an unusual O-mannosyl class glycan composed of a trisaccharide core with xylose-glucuronic acid repeats, presented on the cell surface receptor, Î±-dystroglycan [262] [263] [264] [265] . Once the GPC recognises this so called matriglycan, these arenaviruses can enter the endocytic pathway, where the virions are internalised into endosomal compartments [266] . In the case of Lassa virus, the associated lowered pH induces a conformational change of the GPC that leads to binding to lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) [201, 264] . The subsequent dissociation of GP1 from the GPC triggers viral envelopeendosomal host membrane fusion. It has been suggested that glycosylation is key not only in the primary binding event of GPC but also in the following step of arenavirus viral fusion. Specifically, the sialylated N-linked glycan at position Asn76 on human LAMP1 has been demonstrated to be crucial for Lassa virus GPC recognition [119, 264] . In any case, glycosylation of specific host proteins is critical for the attachment of many arenaviruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
