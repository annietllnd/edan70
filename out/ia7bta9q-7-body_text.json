The overall folds of MTase and RdRP are largely consistent with existing flavivirus NS5 crystal structures for individual enzymes (Figs. 1-2, Fig. S2A in Text S1). The MTase (residues 1-266) is complexed with the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), the demethylated form of SAM. Unlike previously reported RdRP structures, the RdRP region of NS5 is intact, with motifs F and G completely resolved. The linker is largely seen with only three residues (271-273) not modeled due to weakness of the electron density. The missing of residues 271-273 is not a result of proteolysis since the protein is intact in the crystal (Fig. S1D in Text S1). The distance between a-carbon atoms of residues 270 and 274 in the model is about 13 Å , at least 17 Å shorter than any other possible connections in the crystal lattice, thus making the current model unambiguous. Mediated by the linker, the MTase domain is attached to the backside of the RdRP through key hydrophobic interactions (details below), shielding the top-right rim of NTP entry channel (Fig. 1B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
