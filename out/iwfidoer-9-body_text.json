The RNA fraction was treated with DNase I (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 Î¼g of total RNA with random primers (9-mers) using a PrimeScript Double Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara). The resultant cDNA was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
