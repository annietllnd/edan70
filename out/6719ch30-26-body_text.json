For example, hippocampal neurons express CCR2 [21] and CCL2 directly enhances both NMDA receptor-and AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials [30] . This suggests that the earliest stages of hippocampal circuit dysregulation associated with acute TMEV infection may be triggered locally by neuronal CCL2 acting in an autocrine fashion [31, 32] . In this context, it is notable that CCL2 immunoreactivity is strongly upregulated in CA1 neuron apical dendrite tufts located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare at 6 h after infection (Fig. 2) . This layer is an important site of integration between the entorhinal cortex and CA1 pyramidal neurons (the perforant pathway) and is of fundamental importance to spatial and episodic memory formation [33] . It is also the site of GABAergic interneurons that are strongly activated by both entorhinal cortex and CA3-derived Schaffer collateral inputs [34] . These interneurons exhibit both AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor excitatory postsynaptic potentials [35] and are maximally activated at the theta oscillation peak and at the gamma oscillation trough [36] . These cells appear to mediate a robust feedforward inhibition that controls the size and timing of excitatory inputs onto CA1 neurons [37] and synchronizes network firing to theta frequency [34, 36] . Given the important role for hippocampal theta oscillations in learning and memory [38] , it is likely that acute production of CCL2 in the stratum lacunosum moleculare would disrupt cognitive performance. It is also notable that neuronal CCL2 production has been observed following kainic acid- [39] and pilocarpine-mediated seizure induction [40] in rodents and both CCL2 and CCR2 are increased in tissue resected from humans with intractable epilepsy [41, 42] . Inhibition of either CCL2 production or CCR2 signaling suppressed seizures in a mouse model of systemic inflammation and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy [43] . Indeed, Caleo and colleagues have recently suggested that CCL2 "may act as a master regulator of inflammatory processes in the epileptic brain by both directly promoting hyperexcitability and regulating the activity of downstream inflammatory effectors" [43] . Our findings echo this concept and add a third role in which hyperacute neuronal CCL2 production mediates CCR2dependent inflammatory monocyte trafficking into the brain, resulting in the creation of an environment that further disrupts neural function and induces pyramidal neuron death [4, 7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
