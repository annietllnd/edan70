Expression of wildtype and mutant MKK7 were determined by Western blot (Fig. 3b ). Phos-MKK7 was detected at similar level in all IBV-infected cells, but not in mock-infected cells. Because phosphorylation sites were removed in the MKK7-3A mutant, phos-MKK7 detected in MKK7-3A-transfected cells should only represent endogenous phos-MKK7. Thus, it was concluded that phos-MKK7 antibody indeed only detected endogenous phos-MKK7, but not ectopically expressed protein. Notably, transfection of wild-type MKK7 or 3E significantly increased phos-JNK level in IBV-infected cells, as compared with vector control. Transfection of the KM mutant slightly reduced JNK phosphorylation. In MKK7-3A-transfected IBV-infected cells, phos-JNK level was higher than vector control, but lower than in cells transfected with wild-type MKK7 or 3E. PARP cleavage percentages correlated well with JNK phosphorylation: moderate PARP cleavage was detected in vector control, which was slightly reduced in KM, slightly increased in 3A, and considerably increased in cells transfected with wild-type MKK7 or 3E.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
