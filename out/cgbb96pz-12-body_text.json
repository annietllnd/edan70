One study shows that, when expressed in mouse cells, human RanBP2 lacking the RanCyp domain can function equally to full-length RanBP2 in most measures of virus entry into the nucleus [11] . It's possible that the RanCyp domain is not important in the context of infection in mouse cells. On the virus side, the cyclophilin-binding loop of capsid is primarily responsible for the interaction with RanBP2 [13] . Both the cyclophilin-binding loop (virus) and RanCyp (host) are highly variable in sequence [4, 14, 15] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
