One could apply the filters mentioned above, such as the 50-nt rule, although it is quite possible that short peptides are stable and endogenously expressed (Kondo et al., 2010; Ingolia et al., 2011) . Ultimately, all predictions of frameshifted peptides need to be validated with experimental methods.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
