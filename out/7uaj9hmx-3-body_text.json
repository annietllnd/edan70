First identified in Europe and North America in the late 1980s [2] , this syndrome is currently prevalent in most swine-producing countries [3] . Its causative agent, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is a small enveloped positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus, member of the Arterivirus genus [3] . Sequence comparison between viral isolates demonstrated that PRRSV exists in at least two distinct genotypes, the European genotype (EU type or type I) commonly referred to as PRRSV-1, and the North American genotype (NA type or type II) known as PRRSV-2 [4] . PRRSV has a very narrow cell tropism, and may induce persistent asymptomatic infections [5, 6] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
