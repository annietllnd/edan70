The expression of E protein from prM-E-NS1 constructs (both rVSV and rVSV-G1670A vector) was delayed compared to the prM-E constructs, which was probably due to the difference in size of the polyprotein and proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein. Importantly, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 induced significantly higher Th2 cytokines (CD4 + IL-5 + and CD4 + IL-10 + ) and Th17 response (CD4 + IL-17A + ) than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P < 0.05, t-test). This suggests that co-expression of NS1 regulated ZIKV-specific T cell immune response which is critical for virus clearance 68, 69 . Another advantage of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is that it triggered a high level of NS1 antibody which may contribute to protection, perhaps through Fc receptor dependent mechanism. In fact, the viremia in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was statistically lower than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P = 0.0236, t-test) at day 3 post-challenge in A129 mice (Fig. 7a) , suggesting that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 may have a greater protective efficacy. Either the higher T cell immune response or the NS1 Ab could contribute to the enhanced protection against ZIKV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
