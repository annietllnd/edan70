They also demonstrate that countries can work together to develop and conduct successful exercises designed to improve regional preparedness to public health threats. Regular participation in exercises is associated with improved overall response to public health threats [26] . Countries that participated in sub-regional exercises [24, 27] . But exercises are not perfect. Research has called into question the ability of exercises to adequately expose operational and logistical gaps [28] . This is consistent with our finding that exercise participants rated the exercises lowest for identifying key gaps. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on what makes exercises effective tools to assess public health preparedness and how the outputs of exercises such as AARs can be used to support and improve public health preparedness efforts [29] . Thus, the development of standardized evaluation methods for exercises may be an additional tool to help focus the actions to be taken as a result of the exercise and to improve future exercises. Despite these flaws, exercises show great promise as tools to build relationships, assess performance and improve collaborative planning for public health threats across multiple sectors and multiple countries over time.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
