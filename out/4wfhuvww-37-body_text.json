In mass spectrometry (MS), peptides of endogenous proteins are first detected as a mass per ion. In the most common approach, recorded masses are matched to all potential masses in the respective database by search algorithms like SEQUEST, MASCOT, Andromeda, or PEAKS. In a next step, sequence information generated in tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments is employed to identify potential hits within the shortlisted peptide variants. Commonly searched databases by MASCOT are SwissProt, NCBInr, and EMBL EST. These databases integrate cDNA and EST sequences and generally do not contain out-of-frame peptides. However, as MS database search algorithms compute the entire sequence space of potential peptide matches to identify peptides within analyzed samples, it is in principle possible to identify out-of-frame peptides.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
