The EV-B93 3C protease was mixed with a 12-fold molar excess of the inhibitor and incubated overnight at 30°C. The complex was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75 10/300, GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. The collected fractions were concentrated to 2.3 mg ml À 1 for crystallization.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
