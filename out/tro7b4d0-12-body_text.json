However, since these earlier experiments were carried out using a different cell type and expression system, we wanted to confirm that mutating T16 did not impair VLP production. We coexpressed IBV E and the T16 mutants along with plasmids encoding IBV M and IBV N in HeLa cells. The supernatant and cells were collected separately, and VLPs were purified from the supernatant via centrifugation over a sucrose cushion. The level of VLPs produced was measured by immunoblotting and comparing the signal for M in the VLP fraction to the cell fraction. We found that none of the mutations had a significant impact on steady-state VLP production as judged by the amount of M released (Figure 4A 35 S-methionine/cysteine and chased for 0, 25, and 50 min. VSV G was immunoprecipitated from each sample and digested with endoglycosidase H. The mature (**) and immature (*) forms are indicated. Data from control, IBV E, S13A, and T16 A is shown. (D) Quantification of (C) showing that the T16A mutation inactivates the trafficking block. At each time-point the signal intensity for the mature and immature bands was measured. The percent of endo H resistant VSV G was calculated by dividing the signal for the mature band by the total signal (mature+immature). Data are from at least two independent experiments. Error bars represent +/2 SEM. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002674.g001 and B). Thus, T16 is required for altering the secretory pathway, but is not required for VLP production.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
