The delineation of two distinct conformations for each S1 RBD is consistent with observations made for MERS-CoV 17,22 as well as one of the studies of wild-type SARS-CoV S 22 . Gui et al. 15 , however, observed a gradient of conformations in wild-type SARS-CoV S, which has not been observed in other structural studies of coronavirus spikes nor the work presented here. Some possibilities for these different observations may be the differences in spike expression system yielding alternate glycosylation patterns or alternate protein constructs, but the true source remains unclear. The 'down' conformation caps the S2 helices and makes extensive contacts with the S1 NTD. The 'up' conformation of the S1 RBD exposes the S1 RBD receptor-binding site. It has been previously reported that for wild-type SARS-CoV S, 56% of the particles contained three 'down' RBD conformations while 44% contained a single 'up' S1 RBD conformation 22 . To examine the conformation of the S1 RBD among our SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomains, we used a local masking, image sutraction and 3-D sorting strategy 17 to more accurately classify the conformations as being either 'down' or 'up' at each of the three S1 RBD positions within the trimer. This analysis revealed that the majority of the S 2P proteins were in the single-'up' conformation (58%) with lesser amounts of double-and triple-'up' conformations (39% and 3% respectively) and with no all-'down' conformation observed. The increased propensity to adopt the 'up' S1 RBD conformation may indicate a difference in the coronavirus S containing the 2P mutations, however other differences in sample preparation cannot be fully ruled out.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
