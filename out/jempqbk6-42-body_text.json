The double jelly-roll fold is also wide-spread, but so far, has been detected in only dsDNA viruses, and the Sputnik virophage that lacked the official Baltimore classification at the moment of this writing, but is known to possess dsDNA genome [24] . Using structural comparison, we supplemented the set of superfamily 3 helicases (also a virus hallmark proteins) with another distantly-related viral representative and found a link between superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 helicases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
