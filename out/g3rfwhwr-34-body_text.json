These results provide the evidence that picobirnarviruses are present in bats, confirming a previous report [22] . The members of the recently identified family Picobirnarividae are vertebrate viruses infecting a large spectrum of host species, including humans and diverse animals, such as other mammals, birds and reptiles [78] . These viruses have been found mostly in fecal samples and are, therefore, considered to be potential opportunistic enteric pathogens [78] [79] [80] [81] . However, they have also been found in the respiratory tracts of humans and pigs [82, 83] . It is therefore not surprising that picobirnaviral sequences were detected in our pooled bat tissues (including lungs and liver). The prevalence of this viral family in the bat specimens analyzed appeared high (5/9 or 55%) and requires further confirmation in a larger panel of individuals and species. The high degree of sequence similarity between the bat picobirnaviruses found in our study and human picobirnaviruses raises questions about the transmission of these viruses and their capacity to spread to humans, confirming the zoonotic potential of this family of viruses [78, 84, 85] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
