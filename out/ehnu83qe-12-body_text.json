The incident wave of polarized light irradiates the sample as a probe beam and is thereby modified resulting in a reflective or transmission beam having the ability to carry sample information, such as protein layer thickness. When imaging ellipsometry is used to detect layer thickness, the reflection intensity is represented in grayscale, and the variation in layer thickness leads to changes in the grayscale value. If the refractive index is invariant, the grayscale value is directly proportional to the thickness of the protein layer within the range of 0~30 nm layer thickness, i.e., I = kd, where I is the light intensity and d is the layer thickness [28] . Under these conditions k is a constant and can be determined from a protein layer with known grayscale values and known thickness [29] . There is also a relationship between surface concentration and film thickness: surface concentration (μg/cm 2 )K×d, where K = 0.12 [27] . Thus, the grayscale value directly reflects layer thickness and surface concentration. The higher the grayscale value, the thicker the layer and the higher the surface concentration.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
