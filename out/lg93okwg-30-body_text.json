In recent studies [33] , we have found that a second region of Lsm11 interacts with the C-terminal region of FLASH, the same region of FLASH that binds to NPAT [31] . This interaction strengthens the overall binding between FLASH and Lsm11 and could be part of an extensive reorganization of the factors in the HLB to activate histone gene expression as a result of phosphorylation of NPAT by cyclin E/CDK2.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
