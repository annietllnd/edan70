Subconfluent monolayers (90% confluence) of Vero E6 cells in 12.5-cm 2 flasks were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 with the indicated viruses. Culture supernatants were collected at 0, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi), and virus titers were determined as previously described (61) . For the analysis of cell-associated virus, Vero E6 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.001 with the indicated viruses. At 24 and 48 hpi, cells were recovered in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and disrupted by four freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were then centrifuged to remove cell debris, and supernatants were titrated as previously described (59) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
