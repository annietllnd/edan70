Supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. The H7N9 pseudovirus was purified by ultracentrifugation and dissolved in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) before being stored at −80°C in aliquots until their use in the neutralization assay. The 11 HAs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the H7N9-AH HA-encoding gene according to the gene alignment results in Fig. 1b . The HA genes of three HPAI H7N9 variants, including A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017, A/Guangdong/Th005/2017, and A/Taiwan/1/2017, were custom synthesized and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector. All the clones used were confirmed by sequencing. The viral titers were determined in MDCK cells by luciferase activity as the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). Neutralization assays were performed by incubating 100 TCID 50 of pseudovirus with serially diluted antibodies at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was added to the cultured MDCK cells. Viral infection was quantified by the luciferase activity 48 h after infection. An irrelevant human IgG protein (anti-HIV, Immune Technology) was used as a negative control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
