(2017) The Nterminal domains of FLASH and Lsm11 form a 2:1 heterotrimer for histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. PLoS ONE 12(10): e0186034. https:// Biochemical studies of the 3'-end processing machinery that cleaves replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs have shown that it is comprised of the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U7 snRNP), FLASH, and the histone pre-mRNA cleavage complex (HCC) [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] . SLBP binds the 3' stem-loop in the pre-mRNA and remains bound after mRNA maturation, and functions in translation [7, 8] . The 3' stem-loop also recruits the 3'-5' exoribonuclease 3'hExo [9, 10], which is not essential for processing [11] but trims the processed histone mRNAs and initiates degradation of histone mRNAs in the cytoplasm [12] . The core U7 snRNP consists of two integral and stably associated components:~60-nucleotide U7 snRNA and a unique Sm ring, which contains Lsm10 and Lsm11 in place of the spliceosomal SmD1 and SmD2 [13, 14] . The U7 snRNP recognizes the pre-mRNA through base-pairing between the 5'-end of U7 snRNA and the HDE [15, 16] . SLBP bound to the upstream stemloop stabilizes this interaction, likely by directly or indirectly contacting a subunit(s) of U7 snRNP [17] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
