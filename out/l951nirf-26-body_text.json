As shown in Fig 3A, pH1N1 -specific IgG was produced in all vaccination groups after the first immunization and was boosted~2.5-3-fold after the second immunization. A comparative analysis showed that IgG titer was 1.2-fold higher in AcHERV-VLPimmunized mice than in AcHERV-HA-immunized mice, and was comparable to that in mice immunized with killed vaccine. Immunofluorescence micrograph of rBV-infected 293T cells. Seventy-two hours after infection, the cells were incubated with a mouse antibody against pH1N1, followed by incubation with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Mock, AcMNPV-infected cells; AcHERV-HA, AcHERV-HA-infected cells; AcHERV-VLP, AcHERV-VLP-infected cells; Merge, merged image. (D) Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained, purified VLPs from rBV-infected 293T cells. Seventy-two hours after infection, VLPs were harvested from 293T cells, concentrated, and partially purified using 20% step sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. For electron microscopy, VLPs were stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Scale bar, 100 nm (× 100,000) or 200 nm (× 120,000). Wild-type pH1N1 purified A/California/04/2009 influenza virus; AcHERV-HA, purified VLP from AcHERV-HA-infected 293T cells; AcHERV-VLP, purified VLP from AcHERV-VLP-infected 293T cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
