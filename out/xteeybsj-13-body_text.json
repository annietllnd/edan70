Females more frequently had the greatest mean antibody titers and the highest number of animals with low and medium titers, followed by the farrowing crate group. For females, these results may indicate frequent exposure to influenza virus and continuous viral circulation because they remain in the production system longer. The occurrence of high levels of antibodies against influenza virus in farrowing piglets, in association with the decrease of antibody levels over time, is similar to that in a study of serological profiles in farrow-to- finish farms in Taiwan. 25 In that study, the lowest maternally derived antibodies against influenza virus were observed at 3-9 weeks of age, suggesting that animals are more susceptible later in the production cycle. Maternally derived antibodies are able to partially protect piglets against clinical disease, but not against infection, 26 and suckling piglets may become infected and shed virus in their secretions even in the presence of passive antibodies. 3 In such cases, piglets with maternally derived antibodies could play an important role in viral spread in the herd.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
