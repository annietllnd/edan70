By using a replication-independent fusion assay, we confirmed that MHV entry requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis despite the wellknown ability of the MHV S protein to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH. We demonstrate that MHV particles traffic to and fuse in lysosomes. Yet, MHV is much less sensitive to perturbation of the low pH in the endo-/lysosomal system than low pHdependent control viruses VSV and IAV. Our results additionally indicate that, for fusion to occur, the S protein of MHV requires proteolytic cleavage immediately upstream of the FP, like other class I fusion proteins. Efficient inhibition of MHV entry was only observed using a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, and could not be achieved using more specific protease inhibitors. Introduction of an optimal furin cleavage site in the S protein immediately upstream of the FP abolished the requirement for trafficking of virions to lysosomes for fusion. However, this virus still required clathrin-mediated uptake for efficient entry. Consistent with a common mechanism for the entry of CoVs, FIPV, but not MERS-CoV, the latter of which contains a furin cleavage site immediately upstream of the FP, was shown to require trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases for efficient entry. Based on these results we propose a model in which the cleavage site immediately upstream of the FP is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of CoV fusion ( Figure 12) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
