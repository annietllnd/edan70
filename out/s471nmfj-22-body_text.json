To reveal the role of Hsp70 in G1 arrest, Hsp70 was knocked down by siRNA, and the expression of cyclin E and p27 Kip1 was determined. Knockdown of Hsp70 resulted in the significant accumulation of cyclin E, while p27 Kip1 was reduced (Figures 4D,E) . These data suggest that the increased expression of Hsp70 in the cells expressing VP1 at least contributes to the reduced level of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27 Kip1 , which lead to G1 arrest.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
