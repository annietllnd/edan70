SARS Co-V infections resulting from exposure to the index patient were presumed to have resulted in antibody conversion on or before March 24 th (18 days after the index patient's discharge) based on a conservative estimated timeline that includes a 6 day incubation period plus a 12 day interval to seroconversion. The estimated 6 day incubation period is based on the observed median number of days from exposure to illness onset among persons in Vietnam who reported only a single potential exposure to a SARS patient (n = 28). The 12 day estimated interval to seroconversion is based on the observed median number of days from illness onset to SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion among cases in Vietnam for whom the date of seroconversion is known within 48 hours (n = 17). This time frame is expected to exclude individuals who contracted infection from someone other than the index, while capturing the majority of individuals who were infected during index case's hospitalization in Hanoi, including a proportion of those who could have been infected on the last day of exposure to the index patient. The timing of illness onset alone was insufficient as a case selection criterion for the case-control study as this information was unavailable for many study enrollees.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
