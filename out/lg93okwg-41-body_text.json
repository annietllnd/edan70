The eluted samples first passed through a Wyatt multiangle light scattering system (DAWN HELEOS-II) and then a Wyatt Trex refractometer. The data were analyzed using ASTRA version 6 software (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). The monomer peak of 3 mg/ml BSA was used for normalization, delay time determination, and band broadening correction using ASTRA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
