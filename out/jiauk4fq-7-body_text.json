The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive action of BVDV are object of debate, including changes related to decreased lymphocyte proliferation [26, 27] , severe lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues [28] [29] [30] , decreased chemotaxis and phagocytic activity [31] , increased production of prostaglandin E2 [32, 33] , increased NO synthesis in response to lipopolysaccharide [34, 35] and impaired production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [30, [36] [37] [38] [39] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
