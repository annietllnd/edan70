Upon clathrin-mediated uptake these virions are temporarily associated with early endosomes as demonstrated by co-localization with RAB5 during live cell imaging. Furthermore, the importance of early endosomes for entry was indicated by siRNA-mediated downregulation of various proteins associated with early endosomes (EEA1, RAB5A, RAB5B, and RAB5C), which inhibited MHV infection, as well as virus-cell fusion. However, only very few MHV particles appeared to fuse in the early endosomes. Live cell imaging indicated fusion largely to occur in late endosomes and/or lysosomes. Consistently, depletion of host proteins associated with late endosome and late endosome-to-lysosome maturation (RAB7A, RAB7B, and the HOPS complex subunits VPS11, VPS33A, VPS39 and VPS41) or addition of U18666A, which blocks late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, were shown to inhibit both infection and virus-cell fusion. The importance of lysosomes for entry was confirmed by using knockout cells lacking a functional HOPS complex (For a review on the HOPS complex see [54] ). Interestingly, in these cells lysosomes are clustered in a perinuclear region of the cell rather than dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Complementation of the missing HOPS subunit restored the normal lysosome distribution and entry of MHV ( Figure S7 in Text S1). The importance of late endosome-tolysosome trafficking for efficient entry was also observed in murine cells ( Figure S11C in Text S1) and for MHV-S4 carrying the S protein of MHV-4 (JHM; Figures S10 and S12 in Text S1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
