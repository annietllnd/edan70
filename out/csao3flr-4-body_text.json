The antibody exhibited potent neutralizing activity against H7N9 influenza in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we determined the breadth of the effectiveness of HNIgGA6 against divergent H7N9 strains isolated from March 2013 to January 2017, as well as against three HPAI H7N9 variants. A series of representative viral isolates were tested in pseudovirus-based neutralization assays. We report that HNIgGA6 can neutralize the most prevalent H7N9 strains. Other than an early A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9-SH1) isolate, all prevalent H7N9 strains from 2013 to 2017 could be neutralized by this antibody.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
