However, the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by viral infection are far from fully elucidated and many questions still remain unanswered. Can NLRP3 sense viral components directly and, if so, how? Are there any receptors that can coordinate with NLRP3 to recognize viruses? Can viral DNA activate NLRP3 through the DNA sensors-RIP1-RIP3 pathway? A virus such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), could not activate NLRP3 inflammasome by itself (77), so how does it escape the surveillance of the immune system? Elucidating the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation during viral infection will help us to understand the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated diseases better and discover suitable therapeutic targets for viral diseases.
