To identify genes that specifically affected BMV RNA synthesis and/ or accumulation, secondary validation testing of the 42 candidate genes was performed using Northern blotting to analyze RNA3 replication and RNA4 production, as described in the next two sections.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
