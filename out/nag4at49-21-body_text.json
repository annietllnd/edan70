Moreover, the expression levels of newly identified leads reached up to 0.5 g/L compared with ~100mg/L observed for the original anti-PCSK9 lead AX. This demonstrates that this display method is capable of discovering novel high affinity antibody leads with improved production titers.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
