Both the IC and the PBM of E protein are involved in SARS-CoV virulence and replication, whereas the corresponding motifs in protein 3a are not. We showed a dominance of E protein PBM and IC activities over that of the 3a protein homologues. However, the protein 3a PBM became relevant for virus viability in the absence of full-length E protein. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of CoV IC activities and PBMs, with impacts on the rational design of future vaccines and antivirals. Viruses. Mouse-adapted (MA15) (48) parental wild-type (wt) and recombinant viruses were rescued from infectious cDNA clones generated in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (49, (73) (74) (75) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
