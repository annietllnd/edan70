In mammals, dsRNA interaction with RIG-I/MDA5 triggers IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) activation followed by type I IFN induction through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)/ IFN-promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) adapter [24, 25] . RIG-I is essential for triggering innate immune defenses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses [26] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
