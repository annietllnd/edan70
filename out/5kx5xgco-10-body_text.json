Countries that reported having pre-existing exercise programs prior to participating in the exercises described here were much more likely to report conducting exercises at regular intervals over time compared to countries that did not report a pre-existing exercise program. Most countries reported modifying and using some or all of the exercise template materials that were developed for the exercises described here. However, one country that had no prior exercise experience organized and carried out numerous sub-national exercises on their own after participating in the national and subregional exercise. Health leaders in this country reported that participating in an exercise helped to motivate them to develop an exercise program and regularly assess different aspects of their public health preparedness. The largest barriers to continued exercising that were reported included lack of financial resources and limited support among leadership to develop and sustain an exercise program.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
