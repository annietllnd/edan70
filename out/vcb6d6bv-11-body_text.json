Since then, M2 has served as a model protein not only for class I viroporins but also for small single-spanning membrane proteins in general. M2 lacks a cleavable SS, its TM domain acts as a signal-anchor domain recruiting the SRP and subsequently directing the protein to the translocon where insertion occurs co-translationally. Due to the similar size and membrane architecture between class I viroporins (see above) it is generally assumed that all of them use the co-translational pathway in their way to the ER membrane. The different topologies found between subclasses IA and IB would arise from rearrangements of the nascent chain while locating within the translocon (see [33] for a recent review).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
