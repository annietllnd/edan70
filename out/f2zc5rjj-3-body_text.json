After the development of soft lithography techniques using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), PDMS has become the most popular microfluidic device materials and offers several advantages such as easy handling, good sealing properties and high optical transparency [6] . However, the poor chemical stability in different types of organic solvents, difficulty in surface modification and mass production have limited the use of PDMS in the various applications [7] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
