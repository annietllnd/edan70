The structures of the capsid, matrix and envelope proteins and of the viral enzymes were collected from Protein Data Bank [33] in January 2015 and grouped into different datasets according to their biological function, based on their annotation. For each dataset of proteins, sequences with greater than 30% sequence identity were clustered together, since such proteins are almost always homologous and, hence, have very similar three-dimensional structures [58] . We compared the three-dimensional structures of proteins representing each cluster and calculated RMSD and TM-scores [35] for structural alignments. Although intuitive, RMSD is a poor measure for comparing structural similarity across different protein folds: it depends on the length of the aligned regions, in that small protein segments tend to be aligned with smaller RMSD than large and complex structures. Nevertheless, the structural similarity of large protein fragments bears more evolutionary information. TM-score, in contrast, is devoid of these weaknesses and was normalized by the alignment length. It has been shown that TM-scores greater than 0.5 almost always correspond to the alignment of structures with a similar fold [37] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
