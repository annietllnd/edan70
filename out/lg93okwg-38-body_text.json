FLASH NTD mutant constructs (without tag) were cloned into MCS2 of pCDFDuet vector. Both plasmids were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) and the genes were co-expressed in 5 mL LB media. The expressed proteins were co-purified with 15 Î¼L of Ni-NTA agarose beads using the same buffers that were used for large-scale purification of FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
