The activity of the protease was measured by hydrolysis of the FRET-substrate N-Dabcyl-KTLEALFQkGPPVYE(Edans)-NH 2 . The peptide was purchased from Biosyntan (Berlin, Germany). Samples were irradiated with light with a wavelength of 355 nm and the emitted light at 538 nm was measured in relative fluorescence units (RFUs). An amount of 100 pmol of cleaved substrate equals 5,000 RFU.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
