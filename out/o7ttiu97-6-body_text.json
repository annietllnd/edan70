Further, for these studies we chose a low passage clinical isolate, A/Kentucky/180/2010 or KY/180, herein, which has a change in the HA1 gene, D222G, which correlates with increased severity of disease in patient cases from several countries [37] [38] [39] [40] . In mice, infection with H1N1pdm engineered to include this change show increased viral titers and pathology, however, in ferrets there do not seem to be any major differences in clinical signs, transmissibility or pathogenicity [41, 42] . Our results show for the first time, the spatiotemporal progression of inflammation with CT and PET using [ 18 F]-FDG in ferrets infected with H1N1pdm in conjunction with histopathology and viral titers over a seven day period. Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen in the ferret model at 6 days post-infection (DPI) are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections [31] . In vivo imaging with these modalities for anatomic (CT) and molecular (PET) data suggests increased pulmonary inflammation as the amount of circulating virus becomes undetectable. These results suggest that molecular imaging will be a great asset in gaining insight into the temporal and spatial progression of the inflammatory process caused by influenza virus infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
