Using this system, we demonstrated that ATG7 as well as ATG12 expression, but not LC3, are important to obtain a wild-type MW phenotype, as observed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 6) . Furthermore, the morphology of the HCV-induced vesicles was severely altered after silencing of ATG7 or ATG12, but not LC3. Notably, knocking down ATG12 decreased the size and the number of DMVs, whereas silencing of ATG7 mainly affected their size (Fig. 7) . At the moment, it remains unknown whether the altered MW is HCV-replication competent. However, the importance of the ATG5-12 conjugate in HCV RNA replication suggests that the autophagy elongation complex inhibits HCV replication through destabilization of the viral replication factories present within the MW.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
