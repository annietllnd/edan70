It is sometimes assumed that the deadliest pathogens represent recent host jumps where the pathogens' virulence is maladapted to the new host, and that co-evolution between host and pathogen will lead to more benign symptoms over time. However, this is only true in the case of strict vertical transmission (such as from mother to child), where survival and transmission of host and pathogen are intimately linked.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
