One of the proteins identified in this screen was SGTA. Because previous work on SGTA did not evaluate the effect of SGTA depletion on HIV-1 assembly and release, and did not examine a possible connection between Vpu, SGTA, and tetherin, we investigated the effect of SGTA depletion and overexpression on HIV-1 particle production in the presence and absence of Vpu and tetherin. We confirmed that SGTA overexpression impairs HIV-1 release; however, this phenomenon was independent of Vpu and tetherin expression. While we observed that SGTA depletion did not significantly impact virus release or Vpu-mediated tetherin degradation, we demonstrated that SGTA overexpression induced a marked stabilization and cytosolic accumulation of a non-glycosylated, 23-kDa form of tetherin. We propose that the accumulation of 23-kDa tetherin is not a result of inhibition of ERAD but likely due to a block in the translocation of tetherin across the ER membrane.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
