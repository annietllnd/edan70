Because of the variation in this measure from farm to farm it was made stochastic to account for variation between farms. The minimum incidence was 16% for respiratory illness with a maximum of 19%; the minimum of diarrhea was 22% with a maximum of 28%. Based on the selected prevalence, there was a direct relationship to the additional treatment cost for each calf. We modeled a protocol that would include electrolytes and 3 days of antibiotics. We assumed an 85.6% improvement rate and culled the remaining heifers at the end of that week.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
