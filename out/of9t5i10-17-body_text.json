One day after RSV infection, only wild type (WT) mice exhibited pulmonary dysfunction, possibly attributable to inflammatory cytokine responses that cause airway obstruction. Serum anti-RSV antibody responses were significantly attenuated in mice lacking either MAVS or MyD88 and were reduced even further in double KO mice suggesting that both MAVS and MyD8 play an important role in the generation of anti-RSV antibodies, in contrast to antibody production in response to influenza which is MyD88 dependent and MAVS independent [78] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
