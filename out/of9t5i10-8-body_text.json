The majority of respiratory viruses are RNA viruses that can be recognized by TLR7 (recognizes ssRNA), TLR3 (recognizes dsRNA in endosomes) and RIG-I/MDA5 (recognizes dsRNA in cytosol). RNA viruses have either a (+)sense (Group 4) or (-)sense (Group 5) ssRNA genome. Application of TLR3 agonists to treatment/ prophylaxis of two (+) and two (-)sense RNA viruses, each belonging to a different family, will be discussed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
