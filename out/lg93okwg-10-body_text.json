In addition to Cys83, we also mutated the other Cys residue in the FLASH NTD, Cys54, in case it formed a disulfide as well even though the residue was disordered in the structure. The two structures adopt the same coiled-coil dimer (Fig 3A and 3B ) as the wild-type FLASH NTD (Fig 3C) , confirming that FLASH NTD dimer formation does not require the Cys83 disulfide. The individual protomers of these two mutant dimers also show differences, similar to those observed for the wild-type dimer (S1 Fig). Interestingly, residues 53-70 from one of the protomers in the structure at 2.6 Å resolution are stabilized by crystal packing, showing strong electron density corresponding to an α-helix ( Fig 3B) . This protomer appears to form a single long α-helix from residues 53 to 137. The The N-terminal domains of FLASH and Lsm11 form a 2:1 heterotrimer for histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing other protomer showed weak electron density for residues 56-62, while residues 51-55 and 63-66 are not observed (Fig 3B) . These N-terminal residues are disordered in the other two structures ( Fig 3C) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
