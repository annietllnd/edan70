In the classical antibody display paradigms, sorted clones are isolated and their genotypes are subcloned into new production hosts. This cloning step involves screening multiple clones to isolate ones with defined properties. The anchored Fc system side-steps the need for these additional steps by combining selection of antibody affinity and production host in a single experiment. Libraries can be generated and displayed in the cell line of choice, such as Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris. Selected clones can be fermented directly in small or large scale vessels to generate material for in vitro assays such as affinity measurements, cell culture assays, or physicochemical properties. Successful candidates can be fed directly into in vivo preclinical models via simple scale-up production in stirred tank reactors ( Figure 5 ). If desired, once a clone is selected, genetic approaches can be utilized to evict the anchored Fc cassette to generate an antibody production strain.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
