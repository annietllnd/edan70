Paradigm shifts are not easy. Assessments of the adoption of the One Health approach have concluded that while the concept and principles have been broadly accepted and endorsed, operationalizing has been more challenging (17, 31) . These challenges include poorly defined unifying One Health efforts, a lack of One Health champions and partners, limited resource and policy hurdles, among others. However, calls for guidance on how to move beyond concept has resulted in recommendations and roadmaps outlining steps, programme metrics and programme assessments to operationalize One Health (32, 33) . An implementing strategy for Arctic One Health approach will benefit from using one of the recently developed One Health operationalizing ''road maps.'' Two examples include the work done by the University of Minnesota and US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Andrea Meisser and Anne Levy Goldblum (34, 35) . Developing a strategy with process steps, progress measures and well-defined milestones will be crucial in obtaining broad-based support for a regional One Health effort. The implementation strategy process can, and should, assess vulnerabilities, evaluate alternative strategies and programmes for health risks identification and assessments, assess the costs and benefits of those various options and promote their adoption and/or adaptation. Tools for moving this strategy forward are described below.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
