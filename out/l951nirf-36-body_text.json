Two weeks after the final immunization, splenocytes from mice injected intramuscularly with PBS, killed vaccine, AcHERV-HA, or AcHERV-VLP were collected and evaluated for the number of IFN-γ secreted spots from pH1N1-specific T cells in splenocytes. ELISPOT assays were performed using two randomly selected samples from each group (2/12) . Values in parentheses indicate number of mice tested/total number of mice immunized in each group. All experiments were run in triplicate. The data shown are actual number of IFN-γ spot as a scatter dot and mean value as a line. Statistical analysis showed that data were significant with p<0.05 (ANOVA and two-tailed Student's t-test): killed vaccine and AcHERV HA groups were compared with AcHERV VLP group. Previously, we reported on the efficacy of influenza HA vaccination using a HERV encoated-baculoviral DNA vaccine (AcHERV-HA) and showed that its immunogenicity and gene delivery were excellent [21] . Nonetheless, the fact of a vaccine that delivers only the HA gene could not be expected to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies has been questioned.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
