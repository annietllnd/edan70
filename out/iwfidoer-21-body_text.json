The genome size and CDS structure of DCASSRV-1 (11.4 kb) were similar to those of Flaviviridae (9.6-12.3 kb) (21) , and the phylogenetic tree of RdRp indicated that DCASSRV-1 was not classified into the three known Flaviviridae genera (Fig. S4D) . A phylogenetic analysis of RdRp in DCASSRV-2 suggested that the RNA virus was classified into the genus Mitovirus, which has a non-segmented ssRNA genome, infects the mitochondria of fungi, and lacks viral particles (Fig. S4E) . The presence of multiple UGA codons suggested that the putative coding strand of DCASSRV-2 was likely to be translated in mitochondria. The genome size of DCASSRV-2 (4.5 kb) was larger than those of the known mitoviruses (2.3-3.6 kb) (17) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
