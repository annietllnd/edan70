When evaluated against agents that trigger a cytokine storm in the host (H5N1 influenza and SARS), improved survival was observed suggesting that these agonists do not contribute to the cytokine burden induced during viral infection. TLR3 agonists are also effective adjuvants. The major concerns with the use of TLR3 agonists are the toxicity associated with their use and their low efficacy when used as a therapeutic agent instead of as a prophylactic agent. Encapsulation within liposomes has been shown to be an effective means to reduce toxicity associated with the free drug. Continued work to develop regimes for TLR3 agonist therapy is required.
