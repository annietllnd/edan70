To gain more insight into the putative protease cleavage sites in the corresponding region of the S proteins of other CoVs, we analyzed the sequence of this region in several alpha, beta and gamma coronaviruses by performing ClustalW sequence alignment. The fusion peptide sequence was found to be highly conserved amongst the different coronaviruses. Also an Arginine residue immediately upstream of the predicted fusion peptide is highly conserved with the exception of FIPV (serotype II). Interestingly, MERS-CoV and IBV-Beaudette contain a minimal furin cleavage site Arg-X-X-Arg just upstream of the fusion peptide ( Figure 10A ). In analogy with the results obtained with FCS-mutant MHV, we predicted that FIPV and MERS-CoV would differ in their protease inhibitor sensitivity and lysosomal trafficking requirements. To corroborate these findings, we decided to analyze the entry of these two other coronaviruses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
