We observe these proteins in unrelated virus families, where the proteins exhibit significant sequence similarity and conserved structure and function and, hence, very likely share the same evolutionary origin. Gene transfer from a common (possibly past) host is not likely, since these protein families are not represented in cellular organisms. Options for how these genes could have been acquired include gene exchange between viruses, e.g., through co-infection of the same host and recombination, or convergent evolution.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
