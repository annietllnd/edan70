Using all-particles and C3 symmetry yielded a reconstruction at 3.3 Ã… resolution (Fig. 5 , Supplementary Tables S1, S4 and Fig. S10 ). The short loop containing the S1/S2 cleavage site is disordered in the uncleaved S 2P reconstruction and remains disordered in the S 2P trypsin cleaved reconstruction. Moreover, examination of the structure models indicates no significant differences between the trypsin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV S 2P (Fig. 5b) . Fine sorting of S1 RBD positions of the trypsin-cleaved S reveals a very similar distribution of 'up' S1 RBD conformations available for receptor binding as in the uncleaved samples, although we additionally observe a small proportion of S1 RBD in the all-'down' conformation (Fig. 5c) . These results indicate that trypsin-cleavage at S1/S2 does not impart large conformational changes on the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P and justifies the removal of S1/S2 cleavage sites for the production of more homogeneous material as vaccine immunogens.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
