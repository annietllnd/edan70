Sporadic outbreaks of ZIKV have since been reported in Africa and Asia 4 . Historically, people infected with Zika virus have no or mild symptoms including fever, rash, muscle pain, red eyes, headache, and conjunctivitis 4, 5 . However, in 2015 a ZIKV pandemic began in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and the USA, suddenly becoming a global public health issue 5 . Importantly, ZIKV from these recent outbreaks can cause Congenital Zika Syndrome (including microcephaly), Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and other severe neurological disorders 6, 7 . ZIKV is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito although other transmission modes such as sexual, blood transfusion, and maternal-fetal are also possible [8] [9] [10] . Currently, there is no FDAapproved vaccine or antiviral drug for ZIKV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
