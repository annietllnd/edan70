Hence we analyzed the extent to which different protease inhibitors could inhibit MHV entry. Thus, HeLa-mCC1a-DM15 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the different inhibitors, after which the cells were inoculated with MHV-aN in inhibitor-containing medium. Cells were collected, loaded with FDG, and FDG conversion to FIC by complementation of bgalactosidase upon viral fusion was assessed by FACS. Our results indicate that most protease inhibitors tested (Fig. 6 ) hardly inhibited fusion of MHV, if at all. Exceptions were AEBSF, which has been shown to cause aggregation of early endosomal vesicles [75] , and a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor (CPI; cystatinpepstatin inhibitor) capable of inhibiting the three major protease family members found in lysosomes. Thus, by using CPI we measured the combined effects of an endosomal papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (PLCP), an aspartyl protease inhibitor, and an asparagine endopeptidase inhibitor (AEP) [76] . From these results we conclude that inhibition of a broad range of endosomal proteases efficiently blocks fusion of MHV, indicating that efficient entry requires the activity of lysosomal proteases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
