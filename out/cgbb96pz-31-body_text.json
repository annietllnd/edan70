Chimpanzee, Sumatran orangutan, and rhesus macaque gene sequences were obtained from the UCSC genome database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) using the BLAT tool. Additional RanCyp and CypA sequences were sequenced from cDNA generated using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo, #18080051) with oligo(dT) primers. PCR was performed with Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB, #F-531S). Details of the PCR and sequencing strategy, along with primer sequences, are given in S1 ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
