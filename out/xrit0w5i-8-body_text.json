The complete genome sequences of the virus are available from GenBank under accession numbers FJ499463-FJ49947033. The viruses were propagated in 9-day-old embryonated eggs from specificpathogen-free (SPF) hens at 37°C for 60 to 72 h. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Our previous study demonstrated that exogenous trypsin was required for the efficient replication of the H9N2 virus in HUVECs [33] . Thus, 0.25 μg/mL exogenousl-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was added to the medium for all experiments. To inspect the interaction between viral particles and HUVECs, we created inactivated H9N2 viral particles by using 0.094% β-propionolactone (SERVA Electrophoresis) according to previous description [34] , and plaque assay was used to evaluate whether viral replicative capacity was completely destroyed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
