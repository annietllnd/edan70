We developed a PCR strategy based on the 168-bp sequence identified in sera from FTLS patient samples to detect the novel bunyavirus using forward (PF: 5'-GAC ACG CTC CTC AAG GCT CT-3') and reverse (PR: 5'-GCC CAG TAG CCC TGA GTT TC-3') primers designed with Primer3 (Supplementary Figure S1) . PCR was carried out in a 25-mL mixture containing 4 mL of cDNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM dNTPs, 1 U Taq Pol (Promega, M1661), 0.25 mM forward primer, and 0.25 mM reverse primer. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95uC for 4 minutes (denaturation), followed by 35 cycles of 94uC for 30 seconds, 54uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 30 seconds. Amplified products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
