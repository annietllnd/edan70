The MERS-CoV spike protein trimerizes and folds into a metastable prefusion conformation on the virion surface, in which three S1 domains fold into a steady trimer structure and sit on top to stabilize the coiled S2 domains (Figure 2(A-B) ). We and others have identified that the RBD of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be found either buried ('down' position) or exposed ('up' position) in the spike trimer structure [31, [33] [34] [35] . The two conformational states of RBD may have distinct roles during receptor binding and membrane fusion: only the RBDs in 'up' position, but not those in 'down' position, can bind to the cell receptor DPP4 (Figure 2 (C-D)). Great steric clash was observed between DPP4 and neighboring spike protomers when we mapped it to the RBD in 'down' position ( Figure 2(C-D) ). Transformation of the RBD from the buried to the exposed state is therefore a prerequisite for receptor binding (Figure 2(G-H) ). On the other hand, this conformational change also seems to open up the stable cap structure sitting above the S2 cores ( Figure 2 (E-F)). This may lead to disassociation of S1 trimer and exposure of the fusion apparatus, triggering the membrane fusion process.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
