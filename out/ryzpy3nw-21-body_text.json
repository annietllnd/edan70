Baseline serum samples of cats in groups T01, T02, T04, T05, T07 and T08 were negative for FeLV p27 antigen, gp70 antibodies (i.e. ≤90; geometric mean = 10) and anti-FOCMA antibodies (i.e. ≤20; geometric mean = 5; data not shown). Baseline serum samples of the kittens in the additional T03, T06 and T09 groups were negative for FeLV p27 antigen, gp70 antibodies (i.e. ≤90; geometric mean = 10) and anti-FOCMA antibodies (i.e. ≤20; geometric mean = 5; data not shown). Therefore all animals fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the study as defined in the European Pharmacopeia 5.0 Monograph 01/2005:1321 regarding Feline Leukaemia Vaccine (inactivated).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
