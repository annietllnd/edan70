It delineates all functional domains and key motifs of this 905-residue protein. The N-terminal 265-residue SAM-dependent MTase domain is highly analogous to all other flavivirus MTase crystal structures, which are unexceptionally solved with the core polymerase excluded from the constructs. To its C-terminus, the MTase is connected by a 10-residue linker (residues 266-275) whose sequence is highly variable among genus flavivirus (Fig. 3C) . The linker is in turn connected to a 28-residue N-terminal extension (residues 276-303) of the core polymerase. This region is modestly conserved among flaviviruses and its function remains elusive. The core polymerase runs from residue 304 to the C-terminus of NS5, and adopts the canonical viral RdRP cupped right hand conformation with an encircled active site. All seven polymerase motifs (motifs A-G) common to viral RdRPs and reverse transcriptases are properly arranged around the polymerase active site, among which the fingers domain motifs F and G are properly resolved for the first time in genus flavivirus, while the motifs A-E are within the palm domain. The 23-residue priming loop (residues 790-812) project into the polymerase active site as an insertion in the thumb domain, playing a key role in de novo initiation process common to polymerases including those from Flaviviridae and Cystoviridae families [7, 21, 27, 30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
