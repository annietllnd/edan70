Gammaretroviruses have previously been detected in only 10 other bat species, in China, Australia and, more recently, in Ghana [21, 74, 75] . Phylogenetic analysis on the partial amino-acid sequence of the pol protein indicated that this new gammaretrovirus was different from those previously described in bats, thus confirming that bats can harbor a number of genetically diverse gammaretrovirus species. It has recently been suggested that these animals may have played a major role as reservoir hosts during the diversification of mammalian gammaretroviruses [74, 75] . The contig sequences probably originated from viral transcripts, because total RNA was the starting biological material for our viral metagenomic analysis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
