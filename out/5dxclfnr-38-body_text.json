The increased phosphorylation level of Akt post infection corresponds with a decreased level of repressor 4E-BP bound to eIF4E. Inhibition of the PI3K, but not the mTOR1 pathway, suppresses the production of VACV proteins, indicating an mTOR-independent but PI3K-dependent mechanism to regulate 4E-BP repressor activity, as in the case of HCMV [91] . Two of the human papillomavirus (HPV) early proteins, E6 and E7, not only activate Akt/mTOR signaling but also maintain the phosphorylation status by inhibiting the Akt phosphatase PP2A. This results in an inactivation of 4E-BP and in an activation of S6K, supporting viral cap-dependent protein synthesis [92, 93] . These signaling events were recently also shown to be triggered by the HPV-mediated EGFR stimulation during viral entry [94] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
