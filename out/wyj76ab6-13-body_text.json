However this cytotoxic effect seen in vitro does not affect the way the products behave in vivo. The cytotoxicity of test products in disinfectant testing is commonly overcome by dilution of the virusdisinfectant mixture. In order to determine cytotoxicity, the test products were serially diluted ten-fold in MEM up to a dilution of 10 −8 . One part by volume of water of standardised hardness (instead of virus suspension) was mixed with one part by volume of organic load [clean conditions (0.3 g/l bovine serum albumin; BSA) or dirty conditions (3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes)] and eight parts by volume of the test product. Aliquots of 100 μL from each test product at each dilution were then inoculated into six wells of a 96-well microtitre plate containing 200 μL cell suspension BHK-21 cells. The cell cultures were observed for cytotoxic effects for the same incubation time as was later used for the suspension tests.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
