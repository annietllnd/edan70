Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was qualified and RNA integrity was measured by electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose to ensure that there was no RNA degradation. One microgram of the total RNA from each sample was used to create sequencing libraries using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The quality The raw data of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were filtered using FastQC to exclude low quality reads and the reads in which unknown bases were more than 10%. Clean reads were aligned and mapped to human reference genome using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009 ) and assembled by Bowtie 1 (Langmead, 2010) . Differentially expressed genes between the VP1-transfected and control cells were identified using Cufflink (Trapnell et al., 2013) . Genes with a fold change of larger than 1.3 (|log2 (fold change)| > 1.3) and with adjusted P-value less than 0.001 were considered as differentially expressed. The primary data were provided in the Supplementary Materials.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
