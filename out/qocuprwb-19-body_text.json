The brains were homogenized and passaged in BHK cells for 2 days. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant medium of the BHK cells using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. PCR was performed to cover the whole genome sequence using TAKARA Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TAKARA BIO Inc.). The cycle sequencing reaction was performed by using BigDye Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies) and the DNA sequence was determined with Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
