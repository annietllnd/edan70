Briefly, 96-membrane plates were coated with 0.2 μg of mouse IFN-γ capture antibody and blocked with 10% FBS at 37°C. Splenocytes (1 × 10 6 cells) in 100 μl of RPMI-1640 medium were applied to each well and stimulated with inactivated influenza pH1N1 virus for an additional 24 hours at 37°C. Plates were then washed and treated with 20 ng of biotinylated mouse IFN-γ detection antibody for 2 hours. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was then added to the wells, and color was developed using an AEC substrate reagent (BD Biosciences). The number of spots was counted using an ELISPOT reader (AID ElispotReader ver.4; AID GmbH, Straßberg, Germany).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
