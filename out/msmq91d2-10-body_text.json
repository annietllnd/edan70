BHK/T7-9 cells were transfected with those plasmids as described previously [51] . Recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs of PTV Adames or SFSV were designated as rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs, respectively. Recovered recombinant MP-12 were amplified once in VeroE6 cells, titrated by plaque assay, and used for experiments. In addition, we also generated recombinant MP-12 encoding C-terminus Flag-tagged NSs of PTV Adames or SFSV, and those mutants were designated as rMP12-PTNSs-Flag or rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag, respectively.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
