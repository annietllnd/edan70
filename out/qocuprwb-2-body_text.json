Pigs and birds are amplifiers or reservoir hosts of JEV in the environment, providing a source of virus for blood feeding Culex spp. mosquitoes [1] which may subsequently feed on and infect humans. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major public health issue in Asia and the Asia-Pacific region [1, 2] . Annually, 30,000-50,000 cases and 10,000-15,000 deaths are reported and more than 50% of survivors may suffer from neurological disability [2] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
