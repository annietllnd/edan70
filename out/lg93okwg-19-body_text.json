Our AUC results showed that wild-type FLASH NTD and the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant have similar sedimentation coefficients of 1.61 and 1.59 and frictional ratios of 1.81 and 1.86, consistent with them forming dimers in solution (Table 3 ). Both proteins have Stokes radius of 3.2-3.4 nm, while the long-axis radius is about 6.5 nm, based on the crystal structures. The K d values for the wild-type and C54S/ C83A NTD dimers are 0.18 and 0.05 Î¼M, respectively (Table 3) . Wild-type FLASH NTD showed serious aggregation below the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, where some of the proteins apparently dissociated into a monomeric but more elongated form (sedimentation coefficients of 0.89, frictional ratio of 3.09 and Stokes radius of 5.5 nm). Lsm11 NTD alone showed a sedimentation coefficient of 1.22 with a frictional ratio of 1.81, suggesting that it exists as a monomer in solution.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
