The SPF cat livers were histologically unaltered and served to assess FCoV-independent constitutive protein expression. Cytokine expression was mainly evident in the bile duct epithelium which exhibited variable expression of all cytokines ( Figure 2 ). There was also occasional evidence (i.e., in one or two animals for each cytokine) of very low level expression by hepatocytes, represented by a weak, finely granular cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 2G ,I). Furthermore, Kupffer cells in all SPF cats occasionally expressed IL-1Î² and in two and one cat respectively also IL-6 and IL-12 ( Figure 2G ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
