A variety of 20 species of bacteria and 10 species of fungi were isolated from the rectal swabs taken from healthy dogs [25] . Among them, E. coli, Streptococcus mitis, S. lactis, and Enterococci were more prevalent whereas Clostridium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were least prevalent and neither Salmonella spp. nor Shigella were detected. Whereas, Clostridium spp. was most abundant in the fecal samples collected from dogs and cats (>20% on average) [26] . C. difficile was identified to cause of diarrhea in 10-21% of cases and postulated to be involved in some cases of acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome in dogs [5, 27] . Thus, the increased prevalence of C. difficile in the fecal samples in puppies is explained by their normal inhabitance and abundance in the gastrointestinal tract of the puppies, more commonly among the diarrheic animals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
