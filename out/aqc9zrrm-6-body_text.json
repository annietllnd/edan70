However, some arboviral infections result in high fever, hemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, other serious clinical symptoms, and even death. Therefore, they cause a large social and economic burden. A summary listing the arboviruses associated with human diseases and their geographic distributions was published previously. 21 ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
