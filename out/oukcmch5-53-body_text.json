Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT, washed with PBS, and subsequently permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 10 min. Cells were incubated with antibody against LAMP1 (rabbit anti-LAMP1 pAb, 1:100 dilution; Abcam) in 3% BSA in PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to AF488, AF-568 phalloidin, and DAPI (all Life Technologies). The samples were analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica SPE-II).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
