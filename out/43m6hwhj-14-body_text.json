The most extensive changes of gene expression (p < 0.5) were observed in cells from BOR infected group of pigs, where four genes showed over 20-fold change in expression (OAS1, GZMA, MX1 and OASL), while in ILI and DAN infected groups only one gene showed more than 20-fold (OAS1). Similarly BOR strain induced over 10-fold change in expression of 11 genes (CXCL-10-, IFIT3, EDN1, RNASE4, IFIT2, PPBP, OAS2, ACTA, CALD1, LHFPL1), compared to five genes in ILI group (GZMA, MX1, OATV1, CXCL-10, IFIT3) and only of four genes in DAN group (GZMA, MBOAT4, TGM5, CXCL-10).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
