We found that rVSV-G1670A-NS1 triggered significantly higher NS1-specific antibody than pCI-NS1 in mice (Fig. 6e) . As a positive control, recombinant rVSV-G1670A-prM-E triggered a high level of E-specific antibody (Fig. 6f) . At days 3 postchallenge, mice in rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and pCI-NS1 groups had a similar level of viremia (P > 0.05, t-test) but were significantly lower than pCI control (P < 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 6g) . As a positive control, the viremia level in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E group was below or near detection limit (Fig. 6g) . At day 7 post-challenge, mice in the rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups had no detectable viremia (except one in rVSV-G1670A-NS1 group which was near the detection limit) whereas mice in pCI and pCI-NS1 groups still had a significant level of viremia (P < 0.001, t-test) (Fig. 6h) . These results showed that NS1 alone was capable of triggering significant protection against ZIKV-induced viremia and that rVSV-G1670A-NS1 had a higher protection efficacy than pCI-NS1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
