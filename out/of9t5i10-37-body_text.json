When poly (ICLC), an IFN-inducer, was given before RSV infection, mice had a milder disease and / or faster recovery with increased IFN production and reduced viral replication [103] . However, when poly (ICLC) was administered 48 hours post-RSV infection, IFN-production was almost completely inhibited [103] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
