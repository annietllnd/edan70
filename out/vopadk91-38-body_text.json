The following mutations were introduced: S40A (TCA to GCA), S48A (AGC to GCC), Y91A (TAT to GCT), H93A (CAT to GCT), Y109A (TAT to GCT), Y113A (TAT to GCT), Q116A (CAA to GCA), TMD1 Ϫ (including both S40A and S48A), TMD2 Ϫ (including both Y91A and H93A), TMD3 Ϫ (including Y109A, Y113A, and Q116A), and TMD [2, 3] Ϫ (including Y91A, H93A, Y109A, Y113A, and Q116A). The PCR products were digested at flanking SwaI and BamHI sites and cloned into pBAC-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV (49) . Intermediate plasmids were digested with PmeI and BamHI and recloned into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate infectious SARS-CoV cDNA clones for each mutation. To mutate the PBM sequence of 3a, overlap extension PCR was performed using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as the template and the primers indicated in Table S2 , resulting in a DNA fragment containing nt 26044 to 26790 of the SARS-CoV genome. The core 3a PBM (SVPL; nt AGCGTGCCTTTG), was replaced with an alternative sequence (GMSM; nt GGCATGTCTATG). As the 3a and 3b genes overlap in this region, care was taken to introduce only silent mutations into the 3b ORF. The resulting PCR fragment was digested at flanking BamHI and XcmI sites and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV (49) , resulting in pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-3amutPBM. This plasmid was digested with BamHI and RsrII, and the fragment carrying the mutated 3a PBM was reinserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-3a-PBM Ϫ .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
