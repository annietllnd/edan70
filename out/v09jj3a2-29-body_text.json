Our findings do not allow us to discriminate between potential transmission via large droplet versus dilute aerosols, although large scale transmission through a concentrated 'plume' of virus seems less likely here, as proximity to the index patient was nearly universal among those who were infected. These findings have important implications for worker protection, as many different categories of workers perform activities that may bring them into proximity with a SARS-CoV infected individual.
