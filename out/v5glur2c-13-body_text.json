For RNA extraction, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Gibco, USA). Single-stranded cDNA was then prepared from the total RNA extracted, using 100 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase per reaction with an oligo-dT primer (Promega, Madison, USA). For PCR reaction, 1 ml of each cDNA was subjected to PCR reaction using rabbit PPARγ2 primers (PPARγ2 forward 5'CCAGGGGCCGAGAAGGAGA3' and reverse 5'AAGCCAGGGATGTTTTTG 3'). The internal control housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA was also amplified under the same conditions to normalize PPARγ2 mRNA expression (GAPDH forward 5'GCGGAGCCAAAAGGGT CATCAT3' and reverse 5' CAGCCC CAGCATCGAAGGTA GAGG3'). PCR was performed in a DNA thermal circler (Biometra, Germany). The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide and absorbance measured by densitometer (Bio-Rad, Model GS-670, USA). The ratio of PPARγ2 to GAPDH was calculated for quantitative comparison.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
