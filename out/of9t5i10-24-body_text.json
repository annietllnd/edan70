The signaling pathway invoked by poly (IC) administration varies with the cell type responding. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of poly (IC) to WT, TRIF KO, IPS-1 KO and double KO demonstrated that serum IL-6 induction was dependent on both IPS-1 (primarily) and TRIF pathways, whereas IL-12p40 induction was entirely dependent on the TRIF pathway. In the spleen, poly (IC) induction of IFN-, -and -and IL-6 was dependent on IPS-1, whereas IP-10 and RANTES were dependent on both IPS-1 and TRIF. In DC, IFN-and IL-12p40 production was dependent on both IPS-1 and TRIF. Additionally, IPS-1 KO mice had severe defects in poly (IC)-enhanced antibody production whereas TRIF KO mice displayed modestly reduced antibody production [92] . In intestinal epithelial cells, poly (IC) activated IRF-3 dimerization and phosphorylation, increased activity of ISRE, induced IFN-and up-regulated the expression of IFN-regulated genes in a RIG-I and IPS-1-dependent manner with TLR3 signaling not being involved, even though it was expressed in these cells [93] . However, gender differences have been noted in human and Rhesus monkeys, with males having consistently and significantly higher IFN responses than females [94, 95] . Thus, the antiviral activity of IFNs and/or activation of NK cells induced by dsRNA may result in non-specific antiviral defences against a number of viral agents, and may therefore provide a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against viruses, regardless of strain, subtype and drug resistance.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
