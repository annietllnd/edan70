As high Bcl2 level associated with reduced apoptosis in JNK-knockdown cells, we hypothesized that a similar mechanism may function in IBV-infected cells. Wild-type Bcl2 was cloned and S70A mutant was generated, where Ser70 was mutated into alanine. H1299 cells were transfected and infected with IBV. Expression of FLAG-Bcl2 and FLAG-Bcl2-S70A was detected at similar level by Western blot (Fig. 8a) . Phos-Bcl2(Ser70) was detected only in cells transfected with wild-type Bcl2, but not in the vector-transfected or S70A-transfected cells, indicating that endogenous Bcl2 was not prominently phosphorylated at Ser70. Notably, high phos-Bcl2(Ser70) level was detected in FLAG-Bcl2-transfected mockinfected cells without detectable JNK phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of ectopic Bcl2 was not dependent on IBV replication or JNK activation, and might rather be mediated by other kinase(s). IBV infection triggered significant PARP cleavage at 20 hpi and 24 hpi in vector control. In cells transfected with FLAG-Bcl2 or FLAG-Bcl2(S70A), PARP cleavage was completely abolished at 20 hpi and significantly reduced at 24 hpi. There was no significant difference in PARP cleavage between Bcl2-and Bcl2(S70A)-transfected cells of the same time point.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
