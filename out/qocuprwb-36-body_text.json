IL-10 levels in SG, MHG and MLG mice were high compared with those in UG mice. No significant differences were observed between the SG, MHG and MLG ( Figure S2A ). On the other hand, the IFN-γ level in SG mice was lower than those recorded in the UG, MHG and MLG ( Figure S2A ). There were no significant differences of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 levels between UG, SG, MHG and MLG mice ( Figure S2A ). Some mice in the SG showed high levels of TNF-α in the serum, although no significant difference was observed when compared with other groups ( Figure S2B ). IL-10 in the serum of SG mice was significantly increased compared with UG and MHG mice ( Figure S2B ). Corticosterone levels in the serum were also significantly increased in SG mice compared with other groups ( Figure S2B ). Corticosterone, a major glucocorticoid hormone, is a strong immunosuppressant and is elevated under stress response conditions such as those preceding death [55, 56] . Furthermore, severe cases resulting from infection with JaOArS982 exhibited a significant reduction of CD4 + and CD8 + doubly-positive cells in the thymus ( Figure  S2C ). Thymic depletion and body weight loss are the main features of the systemic stress response [55, 56] . These observations therefore suggest that SG mice exhibited a severe systemic stress response accompanied by immune suppression. Thus, the roles of inflammatory cytokines appeared to be different in peripheral and CNS tissues.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
