The high-throughput detection is suitable for mass CMV screening of women of childbearing age. Further, our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of BIE has already reached clinical diagnose standards for anti-CMV IgG. Thus, on the basis of anti-CMV IgG detection, BIE can be used for qualitative and quantitative detection of more types of CMV antibodies using a simple and fast procedure.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
