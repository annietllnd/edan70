Upon providing written consent, participants were asked to complete a short, selfadministered questionnaire and to provide a serum specimen for determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV. Questionnaires were translated into Vietnamese and responses were back-translated into English. Information was collected regarding the participant's contact with the index patient during his stay in the hospital from February 26 th (evening) to March 5th, as well as their symptoms from the time the index patient was admitted to the hospital until 10 days after he was transferred (~1.5 incubation periods [3] [4] [5] ). Self-reported symptoms were checked against case investigation forms for 42 staff members. Participants were asked about whether they had ever engaged in a series of activities relating to exposure to the index patient. Questions were simplified in order to minimize translation errors, ensure that the activities would apply for multiple different staff job categories (e.g., nurse and security guard), and to facilitate self-administration.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
