However, a previous study reported a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude among pilgrims. It has been mentioned that knowledge helps to improve attitude [31] . Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between knowledge and practice. Attitude and practice among the pilgrims had a significant weak positive correlation. These findings were similar to a previous research report, which found a positive correlation between attitude and practice. The r-value suggested that good attitude leads to positive practice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
