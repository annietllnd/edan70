These different possible binding modes were also revealed by the distinct fluorescence quenching spectra, in which their λ max shifts differed significantly (Fig 7) . The docking study showed that N337 interacted with the hydroxyl group on the ring of myricetin, but not dihydromyricetin. Thus, fluorescence quenching of the N337A mutant was also carried out to test whether this residue is important for myricetin binding, but not for dihydromyricetin. Myricetin and dihydromyricetin quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase by 58.4% and 86.3%, respectively (Fig 8) . Adding myricetin and dihydromyricetin resulted in red shifts in λ max of the N337A mutant from 333.5 nm to 341 nm (~7.5 nm) and 357 nm (~23.5 nm), respectively. The λ max shifts of the N337A mutant by myricetin and dihydromyricetin were similar, but still slightly different, to those of the wildtype dihydropyrimidinase (Fig 7) . The K d value of the N337A mutant bound to myricetin ( Fig  8C) , compared with that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase, was reduced to 59.3 ± 8.6 μM (twofold). However, the K d value of the N337A mutant for dihydromyricetin binding was 24.1 ± 1.7 μM, a value nearly identical to that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase, which suggested that N337 was important for myricetin binding but not for dihydromyricetin. These observations indicated that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could still form stable complexes with the N337A mutant, but the binding environment of the active site within the N337A mutant was somewhat different from that of the wild-type protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
