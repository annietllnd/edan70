In mice, prophylactic treatment with two intranasal (i.n.) doses of 1 mg/kg/dose poly (ICLC) provided complete protection against lethal influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) viral challenge [90, 105] and partial protection (63-75%) against A/H5N1/chicken/ Henan (clade 2) [106] . This suggests that poly (IC) did not add to the cytokine storm associated with the mortality of influenza A H5N1 viruses. Mice given one poly (ICLC) dose 20, 16, 14 or 12 days prior to influenza viral challenge and a second dose one day prior to challenge had survival rates of 0, 40, 80 and 100%, respectively [90] . Mice that received liposome-encapsulated poly (ICLC) 21 and 1 day prior to virus challenge were fully protected, thus increasing the short-term window of prophylaxis provided by poly (ICLC) [105] . Poly (ICLC) may thus provide short-term prophylaxis against influenza as suggested by the multi-day window of protection [90] and by the observation that NK cell activity remains elevated for nine and six days post-poly (ICLC) treatment in liver and blood/spleen, respectively [65] . Poly (AU) also increased NK cell activity in the liver but doses approximately 10-fold higher than those used with poly (ICLC) were required [20] . Treatment with a single 20 Î¼g dose of poly (IC) 18-24 hours prior to infection with SARS-Co-V protected mice from lethal disease, with minimal weight loss, enhanced CD86 and CD40 up-regulation of alveolar macrophages, generation of early and robust antigen-specific T cell responses and increased type I IFN production, even though SARS-Co-V is only moderately sensitive to the effects of IFN [81] . Similarly, when poly (ICLC) was given 24 hours prior to RSV infection, marked reduction in viral titres and amelioration of clinical illness and reduced inflammation were observed. However, when poly (ICLC) was given 48 hours post-RSV exposure, poly (ICLC) mediated IFN-production was completely suppressed [103] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
