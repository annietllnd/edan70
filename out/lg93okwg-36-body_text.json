Primers (see S1 Table) designed to mutate designated residues were used in PCR reactions to amplify plasmid templates encoding for wild type or mutant FLASH NTD (see S1 Table for templates used). 25 cycles of thermal cycling (98˚C for melting, 55˚C for annealing, 72˚C for elongation) were performed using Phusion polymerase. PCR products were then digested with DpnI for 1 h at 37˚C before being transformed into E. coli DH5α. Mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
