Comparisons of the relative read frequencies of each major viral contig between total RNA-seq and FLDS revealed that FLDS achieved 0.8-4372.3-fold enrichment for each viral contig (653.2 mean) (Fig. 3) . FLDS also had apparent advan-tages in uniform read coverage and efficiency for retrieving terminal sequences (Fig. 4) . Sequence reads for ssRNA viruses in FLDS were also more abundant than when RNAseq was used for four out of five ssRNA contigs. In addition, by de novo assembly, only six partial viral contigs were obtained using RNA-seq, and no viral contigs specific for total RNA-seq were found. Accordingly, we concluded that FLDS is more efficient than total RNA-seq for the detection and identification of RNA viruses, with the exception of retroviruses, which theoretically cannot be identified using FLDS.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
