Sequence similarities between the 22 putative viral composite genomes were used to classify them into 19 putative viral species, and each of the two genome types was identified in three species (Table 1) . Seventeen dsRNA and two ssRNA viral species were identified and named Diatom Colony-Associated dsRNA virus 1-17 (DCADSRV-1-17) and Diatom Colony-Associated ssRNA virus 1-2 (DCASSRV-1-2) ( Table 1 ). Since ssRNA viruses form an RNA duplex as an intermediate in genome replication, these contigs were most likely derived from replicating ssRNA viruses (11) and not from contaminant ssRNA. An additional seven full-length viral segments with predicted CDSs were also identified; however, we were unable to determine the combination of their segments or reconstruct viral genomes based on information from previously reported viruses. Thus, these viral segments were assigned as Diatom Colony-Associated Virus-Like RNA Segments (DCAVLRS-1-7).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
