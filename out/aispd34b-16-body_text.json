Transcript abundance was determined according to the Î”Ct (cycle threshold) method, in which the Ct value for each specific gene was compared with that of the endogeneous control, and by calculating the relative copy number, based on the specific standard curves for each gene. Standard curves for the cross-intron primers were not generated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
