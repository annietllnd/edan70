Microneedle inoculation of vaccines has been used in preclinical evaluation of several vaccines, including inactivated polio vaccine [67] , influenza vaccine [68, 69, 70] , and measles vaccine [71] . Clinical application of vaccines to the skin has also been documented for a number of vaccines, including influenza vaccine [72, 73] , and rabies vaccine [74] . Recent studies have suggested that vaccine delivery through the skin takes advantage of the abundant presence of skin-resident antigen-presenting cells, including different subsets of dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, as well as infiltrating antigen presenting cells, to provoke robust immune responses that include both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [65] , and induce long-lived CD8 + T cell memory [75, 76] . Moreover, data on the delivery of different types of vaccines through the skin suggest that both live vaccines and subunit vaccines can be administered through the skin, with successful immunization outcomes [67-71, 73,74] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
