Treatment of infected cells with the pharmaceutical PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduces viral titers by more than 4 logs. Surprisingly, rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), as opposed to LY294002 treatment, does not diminish viral protein synthesis, indicating an HCMV-induced, mTOR-independent mechanism to maintain translation [86] . Later it was indeed found that HCMV phosphorylates two downstream targets of mTOR: the transcriptional repressor 4E-BP and the scaffolding protein eIF4G to maintain the activity of the eIF4F complex. Thereby, both phosphorylations are in fact mTOR-independent, whereas the phosphorylation of 4E-BP is PI3K-dependent, explaining the diminished viral protein synthesis after PI3K inhibition [87] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
