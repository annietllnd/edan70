In several clinical test applications, we found that EOPM technology is sensitive enough to detect the pathogens causing evident clinical symptoms. EOPM is designed for easy operation, with detection software containing a user-friendly interface, facilitating its application in molecular laboratories. Infectious disease epidemics emerge frequently in China, and we believe that the use of EOPM in main pathogen surveillance sites across the country could play an important role in infectious disease control in China.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
