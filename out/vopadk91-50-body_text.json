The potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the cis side, whereas the trans side was set to ground. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used in the voltage-clamp mode to measure the current and the applied potential. The chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). Single-channel conductance data were obtained from current measurements under conditions of an applied potential of Ï©100 mV and were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma plot 12 (Systat Software, Inc.).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
