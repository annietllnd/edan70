Recovery of recombinant VSV (rVSV) from the infectious clone was carried out as described previously 72 . Briefly, rVSV was recovered by cotransfection of plasmid encoding VSV genome, and support plasmids encoding VSV nucleocapsid complex (pN, pP, and pL) into BSRT7 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expressing T7 RNA polymerase (kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Moss). At 96 h post-transfection, cell culture fluids were collected and filtered through a 0.2-Âµm filter, and the recombinant virus was further amplified in BSRT7 cells. Subsequently, the viruses were plaque purified as described previously 72 . Individual plaques were isolated, and seed stocks were amplified in BSRT7 cells. The viral titer was determined by a plaque assay performed in Vero cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
