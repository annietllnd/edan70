Utilization of labor and milk source requires additional decisions based on resources and availability. While gaining in popularity, only 1.9% of the calves were fed through an automatic feeder while almost half of the surveyed calves were fed using a bottle or a bucket [9] . On average, one calf requires 7-12 labor hours during the pre-weaning period, or 7-10 mins per day [8] . Unpasteurized whole milk was the most common milk source utilized by producers but close to 50% of those also utilized milk replacer [7] . More recent surveys show a similar trend, with 40.1% of calves fed whole or waste milk, 34.8% fed milk replacer, and 25.1% fed a combination of the two. Calf starter was provided, starting on average at 5 days old, to all calves surveyed [9] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
