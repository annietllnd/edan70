For the sequence comparison, all complete viral proteomes (as of June 2015) were downloaded from UniProt [25] , and all proteins were compared pairwise with BLAST (version 2.2.21) [26] . Only hits with e-value less than 1e-05, sequence identity more than 30% and alignment length more than 50 amino acids were kept. Of these pairs, we selected those where the sequences come from viruses belonging to different Baltimore classes. The resulting sequences were scanned against the Pfam database of protein families [27] with HMMer (HH-suite Version 2.0.15) [28] using the default inclusion threshold of 0.01. Then, the corresponding HMM profiles were used to collect all related sequences from the reference viral proteome set. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed with RAxML (Version 8.0.24) [29] using the PROTGAMMAJTT model and 100 replicates for the calculation of the bootstrap support. The trees were visualized with Dendroscope (Version 3.2.10) [30] . The corresponding nucleotide sequences were retrieved from ENA [31] , and their GCcontent was analyzed using CodonW [32] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
