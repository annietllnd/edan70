HEK293T cells were transfected with either eVP40-WT (Fig 3C) or mVP40-WT (Fig 3D) , and once again cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either nonspecific IgG, or anti-VP40 antiserum as indicated. Endogenous BAG3 was detected in precipitated samples by Western blot using anti-BAG3 antiserum (Fig 3C and 3D ). Endogenously expressed BAG3 was detected in both eVP40-WT ( Fig 3C, lane 2 ) and mVP40-WT ( Fig 3D,  lane 2) precipitates, but not in preimmune IgG precipitates (Fig 3C and 3D , lanes 1). Together, these results correlate well with those from the GST pulldown assays and indicate that eVP40 and mVP40 interact with full length BAG3 in a PPxY-dependent manner.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
