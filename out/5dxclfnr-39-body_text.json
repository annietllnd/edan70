Two viral proteins, E4-ORF1 and E4-ORF4, function to mimic incoming signals to activate this pathway. Interestingly, the proteins seem to act via different mechanisms as only E4-ORF1 is necessary and sufficient for the PI3K-dependent activation of S6K, whereas E4-ORF4 acts independently of PI3K. Both proteins seem to collaborate to induce mTOR activity, independent of the stimulation by nutrients or growth factors.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
