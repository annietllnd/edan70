The 500 µL of isopropanol was added to the supernatant and kept at −20°C for overnight incubation. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the pellet and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. 15 µL of NFW was added to the RNA pellet. cDNA synthesis was performed with random primers and RevertAid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase as per the manufacturer's instructions: The cDNA obtained was used as templates for PCR assay, the live attenuated Rotavirus vaccine (Human Rotavirus RIX 4414 strain) and killed CCoV vaccine (NL-18 strain) were used as positive controls.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
