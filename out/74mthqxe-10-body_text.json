We observed that, indeed, the entry of JSRV and IAV, and to a lesser extent that of VSV, was enhanced in K562 cells stably expressing shRNA against IFITM1 or 3 (kind gifts of Michael Farzan and I-Chueh Huang, Harvard Medical School) [13] as compared to the parental K562 cells ( Fig. 1F ; p,0.01 or 0.05). The entry of 10A1 Anti-FLAG and anti-b-actin were used as primary antibodies to detect IFITMs and b-actin, respectively. (E) 293 cells were treated with 500 units of IFN-a2b for 24 h, and infected with indicated MLV-GFP pseudovirions. The viral infectivity was normalized to that of cells in absence of the IFN-a2b treatment. (F) K562 cells stably expressing control shRNA or shRNA targeting IFITM1 or 3 [13] were infected with MLV-GFP pseudovirions bearing indicated viral glycoproteins. The infectivity was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to that of parental K562 cells (Mock) infected with same amounts of indicated pseudovirions. Typically, an MOI of 0.05-0.2 were used for all GFP pseudovirion infections. In all cases, averages 6 SD of at least three independent experiments are shown; * denotes p,0.05; ** denotes p,0.01. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003124.g001 MLV was also slightly enhanced by shRNA targeting IFITM1, but the increase was not statistically significant ( Fig. 1F ; p.0.05). shRNA did not significantly reduce IFITM2 in K562 cells, and thus we could not assess the consequences of reducing of this protein (data not shown). Overall, these results suggest that endogenous IFITM proteins intrinsically restrict JSRV, IAV and VSV entry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
