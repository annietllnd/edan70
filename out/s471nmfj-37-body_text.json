The inconsistence is due to different experimental settings. Our previous study primarily focused on the nuclear localization character of VP1. We emphasized the difference between the outcomes yielded by VP1 and VP1 H220T , a mutated VP1 which loses the nuclear localization capability, in order to confirm that the nuclear translocation of VP1 disturbs cellular functions. Therefore, the cell cycle test was controlled by the cells expressing VP1 H220T and normal cells, which had not been treated with the control plasmid pEGFP-C1. Later we realized that VP1 H220T may not be a proper control for the cell cycle evaluation, because it may disturb the nuclear function. Our microscopic observation showed that VP1 H220T binds to the nuclear membrane and blocks the nuclear pores (Wang et al., 2012) . In this study, with an optimized experimental setting, we demonstrate that VP1 of CVB3 actually caused G1 arrest.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
