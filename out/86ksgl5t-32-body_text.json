The functions of some of the genes that were strongly induced by IFN-λ3 have been reported, but the functions and mechanisms of more genes remain unclear. RSAD2, a host viral restrictor gene, showed the highest upregulated levels after IFN-λ3 rather than IFN-α stimulation, whereas MX1 was the most highly upregulated gene after IFN-α stimulation. A previous study demonstrated that porcine RSAD2 effectively inhibited CSFV replication in vitro, and this effect might occur via the interaction of RSAD2 with CSFV E2 protein in the cytoplasm (28) . Our study found that RSAD2 transient expression also substantially curtailed PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells in vitro, but the mechanism is unclear. MX2, an IFN-induced GTPbinding protein (36, 37) , reportedly inhibits the replication of lentivirus HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) in vitro (38, 39) . The function of porcine MX2 has been poorly studied. We confirmed that porcine MX2 inhibits PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells. We also discovered some unknown genes that were differentially expressed in response to IFN-λ3 or IFN-α stimulation, and this finding might provide a foundation for further elucidation of the different mechanisms of action of IFN-λ3 and IFN-α.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
