According to this, in the course of certain acute viral infections, platelets may be activated in vivo, leading to their degranulation, Figure 6 Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of calves with and without pre-existing BVDV challenged with BHV-1.1. An immunohistochemical study revealed the presence of septal MΦs and PAM positive for TNFα (A) and IL-1α (C) associated with sites of inflammation in the pulmonary parenchyma of the BVDV/BHV-1 group at 2 dpi. However, the calves of the BHV-1 group presented a higher number of IMΦs reactive to TNFα (B) and IL-1α (D) in the peribronchial areas of the lung at 2 dpi. aggregation and withdrawal from circulation [47] [48] [49] . The procoagulant activity of BVDV and BHV-1 has been reported in vitro [50] . In our experimental study, it was increased in the co-infected calves due to the concomitance of both agents in the lungs between 2 and 7 dpi. Despite the absence of BVDV in the blood of these calves at the moment of BHV-1 inoculation, it does not completely disappear, being detected by PCR in the lungs and by IHC in lymphoid tissues throughout the experience [51] . However, there was no evidence in any stage of direct interaction between these viruses and platelets, which would suggest that platelet activation may be enhanced by indirect mechanisms including the expression of inflammatory mediators released by MΦs, which are known to play a major role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis [11, 52] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
