Of these, only CCL2 and CCL7 were expressed at detectable levels in our mice (Fig. 1) . To determine the relative contribution of these two chemokines to inflammatory monocyte recruitment during acute TMEV infection, we used immunodepletion to neutralize each factor. LysM-GFP monocyte-neutrophil reporter mice [4] received 20 μg goat anti-CCL2 IgG, 20 μg goat anti-CCL7, or 20 μg goat IgG by intraperitoneal injection at − 12, 0, and + 12 h relative to time of infection. Brain-infiltrating leukocytes were isolated at 24 hpi and analyzed by flow cytometry to count inflammatory monocytes (CD45 + GFP mid ) and neutrophils (CD45 + GFP hi ) (Fig. 4) . Mice treated with control IgG had approximately 5000 monocytes and 4000 neutrophils (Fig. 4a, d) in the brain infiltrate. This was reduced to about 3500 monocytes and 3500 neutrophils in mice treated with anti-CCL7 antibody (monocytes, F = 61.0887, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; P < 0.001 vs control IgG by Dunnett's method; neutrophils, F = 54.4998, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; P = 0.0879 vs control IgG by Dunnett's method) (Fig. 4c, d) . More profoundly, treatment with anti-CCL2 antibody reduced the number of monocytes and the number of neutrophils to about 1500 each (monocytes, P = 0.0005 vs control IgG by Dunnett's method; neutrophils, P < 0.0001 vs control IgG by Dunnett's method) (Fig. 4b, d) . For monocytes, this suggests that about 70% of the infiltration in response to TMEV infection is dependent upon the CCL2:CCR2 axis and about 30% requires the CCL7:CCR2 axis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
