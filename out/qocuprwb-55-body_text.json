Our results did not support this possibility. We also identified specific immune responses including TNF-α and IL-10 up-regulation in the brains of severe cases when compared with mild cases. In human cases, an increased level of TNF-α in the CSF appears to correlate with JE disease severity [8] . Therefore, this JEVinfected mouse model appears to be a reproducible model of severe JE disease in human cases. Furthermore, from the results of increased fatality in TNF-α KO mice, we propose that increased levels of TNF-α in the brains of severe cases in WT mice were probably produced in response to the disease severity, to alleviate the pathological impact of the encephalitis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
