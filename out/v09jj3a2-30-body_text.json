When Hospital A closed during the SARS outbreak, a second hospital (Hospital B) was designated to care for suspect SARS cases. There were no SARS cases among staff at Hospital B, and a serosurvey conducted among workers at the facility revealed no inapparent or asymptomatic infections despite the presence of numerous confirmed SARS cases in the wards [1] . The reasons for the disparity in infection rates among staff between Hospitals A and B is unclear, but comparing outcomes between the two hospitals in general supports the importance of enhanced infection control measures, barrier protections, and patient isolation, as control measures within hospitals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
