It is important in determining attachment and houses most of the virus epitopes, which can affect the virus serotypes [2, 8, 7] . The nucleotide sequence of the partial S1 gene used in this study (XCE2+/XCE2âˆ’) only covers the hypervariable region (HVR)-3 of the S1 gene [22] but does not cover HVR 1 and HVR 2. This present study indicated that within the section of the parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16 gene that was sequenced, there was 100% similarity with several IBV 4/91 strains taken from GenBank, which included both ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
