In brief, blood samples were collected from mice and sera were obtained. Ninety-six well plates were coated overnight with 8 hemagglutination units (HAU) of inactivated pH1N1 using standard methods, as previously described [30, 31] . The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Results are expressed as reciprocals of the final detectable dilution.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
