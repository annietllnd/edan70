Serological profiles against this antigen in each studied area are shown in Figure 2 . One farm (F16) from area 3 had a higher mean antibody titer in the farrowing crate group than in breeding animals (female group) ( Figure 2 ). This situation also occurred at two farms from area 2. The serological profiles from areas 1, 3, and 4 followed a characterized pattern of antibody profiles in which the antibody titers were higher in the female group and decreased through 8-14 weeks of age when seroconversion by natural infection normally occurs. In contrast, the serological profiles from area 2 varied greatly, and in some farms, seroconversion occurred earlier (4-7 weeks) in the production system ( Figure 2 ). In addition, some farms had detectable antibody levels throughout all ages, and the means of the antibody titers did not reach negative values, suggesting that the virus had recently circulated in all groups at these farms. Furthermore, F10 showed relatively constant mean antibody titers throughout the production cycle, suggesting virus circulation in all categories. Additionally, one farm (F8) had no anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies at all ages, suggesting that the H1N1pdm09 virus was not circulating in the herd at that moment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
