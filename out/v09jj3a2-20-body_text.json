The lowest rates of participa-tion in the exposure and symptom survey occurred among physicians and ICU nurses staffing categories (58.6%, 57.1%, respectively), but in both instances participation increased to over 64% for the serosurvey (Table 1) . Staff work schedules were used, where possible, to independently verify a worker's presence at Hospital A during the index patient's hospitalization. A comparison between staff work schedules and worker responses is shown in Table 2 . In general, there were fewer non-clinical staff than clinical staff participants in the serosurvey, but overall, serosurvey participation met or exceeded 50% in all but five staffing categories, these being, 'kitchen', 'dental', 'laboratory', 'administration', and 'reception'.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
