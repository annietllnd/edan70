In countries such as Australia where there has been a substantial increase in MHL research over the past 10 years, there has been a major focus on common mental disorders, most notably depression [17, 18] . Given the importance of early helpseeking, self-help and social support in reducing the burden of disease related to depression, this may also be a useful strategy for public education in China. The increasing prevalence of depression [50] and more mass media reports of depression cases or suicide cases related to depression among celebrities may also contribute to the greater awareness of depression among the population [51] . Psychosis has long been a priority in mental health management in China, partly due to its relatively greater burden on individuals and families, as well as its perceived influence on the safety and stability of the whole society [10] . The relatively high number of studies focusing on suicide is likely to be explained by concern about the suicide rate in China, which is among the highest in the world. In comparison, anxiety disorders have been the focus of relatively little MHL research (n = 29), although these disorders are reported to be the second most prevalent category of mental disorders in China [9] (with the first being mood disorders). The limited number of studies on substance use, bipolar disorder, mania or OCD and the gap in trauma/PTSD studies highlight the need for a wider range of mental disorders to be covered in the field of MHL research.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
