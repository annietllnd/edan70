Thus, we investigated whether envelope proteins were involved in the induction of IFITM1 expression. We incubated HUVECs with HA or NA protein at different concentrations. Supernatant in each group was collected at 6, 12 and 24 h for ELISA assay, cells were extracted for Real-Time PCR analysis. The results showed that interferon-α/β levels were not significantly increased after treatment with HA or NA (P > 0.05, ANOVA) in both BEAS-2Bs and HUVECs (Fig. 3) . As shown in Fig. 4 , the mRNA levels of IFITM1 were not significantly increased at 6, 12 and 24 h (P > 0.05, ANOVA) in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs. The results suggested that the HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to induce the expression of IFITM1 in HUVECs or BEAS-2Bs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
