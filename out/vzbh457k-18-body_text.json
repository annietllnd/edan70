Data are expressed as the number of IFN-γ-secreting cells per two hundred thousand splenocytes. Peptide-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT responses were considered to be positive if the response (minus media background) was ≥ 3fold above the media response and ≥ 50 spot-forming cells (SFC)/2 × 10 5 splenocytes were registered.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
