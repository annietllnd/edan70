Plaque assay was performed on MDCK cells as described previously [39] . Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded into 6-well plates. Confluent monolayers were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and infected with H9N2 virus or cell culture supernatants. The inoculum was discarded after incubation for 1 h and the remaining cells were washed with PBS. An overlay consisting of a mixture of 1.6% agarose (Lonza) and doublestrength DMEM with 0.25 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Worthington) was added to the above cells and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Plaques were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and counted.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
