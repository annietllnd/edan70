Incubation of the dsRNA ladder with BTV NS4 or GIV NS4 alone did not alter dsRNA integrity. dsRNA preincubated with NS4 of GIV was protected against Dicer cleavage, consistent with previous findings regarding the presence of a dsRNA-binding domain. However, BTV NS4 did not protect dsRNA against Dicer and dsRNA was still processed into 21 bp long fragments, as analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis ( figure 21) . Incubation of dsRNA with BAV outer capsid protein VP9 (as a control) did not affect Incubation of a dsDNA ladder (2645-36 bp) with DNAse I led to degradation, while incubation with BTV or GIV NS4 only did not affect dsDNA integrity. However, dsDNA pre-incubated with either BTV or GIV NS4 was at least partially protected against ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
