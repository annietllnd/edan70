Since L929-conditioned medium increases viral titers, we hypothesized that it might be due to an increase in cell permissivity resulting from an increase in PRRSV receptor expression. To test this hypothesis, we cultivated monocytes in medium containing pig serum alone or in L929-conditionned medium for 7 days and then treated them with tulathromycin. MDMs differentiated in medium devoid of L929-supernatant expressed both receptors. Approximatively 28% of cells expressed CD163 and 89% of cells expressed CD169. Tulathromycin treatment did not significantly change the percentage of CD163 and CD169 positive cells (respectively 29% and 83% of positive cells) (Fig 14A; upper panels; Fig 14B) . MDMs incubation in L929-supernatant supplemented medium was sufficient to significantly increase the number of CD163 positive cells (more than 90% of MDMs were CD163 positive versus less than 30% in pig serum supplemented medium alone). In addition, following L929-supernantant exposure we were not able to detect any CD169 positive cells (Fig 14A; lower panels; Fig 14B) . Tulathromcyin treatment following L929-incubation did not have any significant effect on viral receptor expression in these experiments (Fig 14A; lower panels; Fig 14B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
