We found that ssIBV E disrupted protein trafficking similar to IBV E ( Figure 7A and B). FLAG-IBV E did not disrupt trafficking to the same extent as ssIBV E or IBV E but still had some effect ( Figure 7A and B) . This could indicate the IBV E hairpin does have some effect on trafficking, albeit to a smaller degree. It is also possible that a portion of FLAG-IBV E is inserted in a transmembrane topology and this small pool of protein is sufficient to alter trafficking, but insufficient to disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
