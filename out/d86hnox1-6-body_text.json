We start from a pair of protein domains, whose amino acid sequences we denote X and Y. The goal is to determine homologous amino acid sequences X′, Y′ such that the coding sequence of the smaller protein is entirely embedded within that of the larger protein, being coded either on the same DNA strand in a different reading frame or on the opposite strand. The five choices of reading frames for Y are shown in Fig. 1 . We choose a reading frame F = −2, −1, 0, 1, or 2 for Y, and a starting point for the smaller of the two proteins, such that its coding sequence will be entirely embedded within that of the larger protein. Applying a sequence optimization algorithm described below, we obtain the protein sequences (X′, Y′), which are as similar as possible to X, Y and whose coding sequences completely overlap. The similarity is measured by a Blosum similarity score, summed over the length of both proteins:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
