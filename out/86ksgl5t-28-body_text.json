Despite the similarities between the effects of the two types of IFNs, increasing evidence demonstrates that each class of IFN is essential for antiviral host defense and is not functionally redundant (2) . A previous study in mice demonstrated that the role of IFN-λ in functionally redundant intestinal viral infections cannot be compensated by IFN-α/β (20) . Therefore, clarification of the induction of cell-specific IFN signaling profiles is essential for understanding the non-redundant roles of IFN-λ and IFN-α in viral infection at the tissue and organism levels. In this study, we found that the transcriptional profile induced by type III IFN in the intestinal epithelia The differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. P < 0.05 was considered significant, and the p values are expressed as follows: *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p <0.005, and ****p < 0.001.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
