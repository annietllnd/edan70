Delivery methods included face-to-face lectures, bulletins or booklets, although a few MHL studies used computers [23, 38] or the internet [39] . Related to the commonly-used KAP delivery method, most interventions focused on evaluation of changes in knowledge or attitudes. Though a limited number of surveys asked about respondents' intentions to provide help or first aid to others with mental health problems, no interventions aiming to promote such actions were found in this review. Furthermore, compared to the relatively large number of interventions targeted to patients or their carers (n = 21, accounting for 44.7% of all interventions) and non-mental health professionals and GPs (n = 16, 34.0%), little attention has been paid to MHL interventions for members of the public (n = 10, 21.3%). validation study of one (out of eight) of its questionnaires about mental health knowledge awareness among middle school students [42] , despite this questionnaire being originally developed for the general population. The tool developed by the Shanghai Mental Health Centre has been partly validated [43] .
