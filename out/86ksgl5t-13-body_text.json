The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT and then blocked with blocking buffer (PBS with 5% FBS and 5% skim milk) for 30 min at 37 • C. The cells were then incubated with PEDV N protein antibody at 37 • C for 2 h and then labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 37 • C for 1 h. DAPI (Sigma, USA) was used for the staining of cellular nuclei. The stained cells were visualized using an AMG EVOS F1 fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
