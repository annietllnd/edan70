Exploitation of the adaptive immune system as a defence against viral infections has been used extensively since 1796, when Edward Jenner inoculated James Phipps with cowpox and then later challenged him with variolous material [1] . Vaccination utilizes the adaptive immune system to mount a specific immune response in the aim of disease prevention, and its use has resulted in eradication of certain diseases from the population, most notably small pox. Production of effective vaccines can be limited by genetic instability leading to reversion of an attenuated strain to a virulent strain with resultant infection in the vaccinated individual, heat sensitivity of the vaccine necessitating a requirement for refrigeration which is not always possible in developing countries, the lack of good antigenic proteins for subunit vaccines, among other limitations [2, 3] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
