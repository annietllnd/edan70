To further confirm whether the IFN-λ3induced gene expression profile in enteroids was the same as that in IPEC-J2 cells, we stimulated enteroids with IFN-λ3 or IFN-α under the same conditions as IPEC-J2 cells and evaluated their gene expression by RT-qPCR. In all three groups, the expression pattern of the genes induced by IFN-λ3 and IFN-α in porcine enteroids was consistent with that found in the IPEC-J2 cells (Figure 7) . In the classical ISG subgroup, the upregulated levels of MX2 and IFIT3 elicited by IFN-λ3 were ∼3-to 5-fold higher than those induced by IFN-α ( Figure 7A ). In contrast, the upregulated levels of OASL and OAS1, which belong to the weakly IFN-λ3-induced gene subgroup, induced by IFN-λ3 were 2-fold higher than those induced by IFN-α, and the fold change difference was moderate ( Figure 7B) . For the strongly IFN-λ3-induced gene RSAD2 and PLAC8, just as we observed in the other subgroups, Enteroids were or were not primed with IFN-λ3 (1,000 ng/ml) or IFN-α (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h, and the total RNA from the enteroids was extracted and used for RT-qPCR. The differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. P < 0.05 was considered significant, and the p values are expressed as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, and ****p < 0.001.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
