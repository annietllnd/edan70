In the case of hemagglutinin esterases of coronaviruses and orthomixoviruses, lateral gene transfer, but not its direction, has been previously reported [72] . We can now identify this direction as coming from the latter into the former. For cysteine proteases of Aphthovirus, coronaviruses and cytomegaloviruses and for methyltransferases of Flaviviridae and Poxviridae, the available data are insufficient to draw any concrete conclusions, but their structural similarity to proteases and methyltransferases of cellular organisms suggests that genetic transfer events happened very anciently. However, for both proteases and methyltransferases, we cannot rule out that the similarities observed with proteins of cellular organisms are the result of convergent evolution processes that caused the same fold to be present in viral and cellular proteins. Further investigations will be needed in order to elucidate the origin and evolution of these two classes of viral proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
