In the JEV NS5 structure, the Zn 2+ bound to the pinky finger ( Fig. 2A , Zn-1) has equivalent coordination partners (E440-H444-C449-C452) as previously observed, likely playing structural roles. The second Zn 2+ is located between the thumb and motif E in the palm ( Fig. 2A , Zn-2), a pivoting region that may be important for the commonly observed relative movement between thumb and palm [24] [25] [26] , and might have regulatory roles to the polymerase as previously suggested [8] . It differs in one coordination partner comparing to that in the DENV structure (H717-C733-E848-C852 vs. H712-C728-H714-C847), while the WNV structure has a disulfide bond (C733-C852) at the same site [7, 8] . However, the functional consequences of these differences remain to be investigated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
