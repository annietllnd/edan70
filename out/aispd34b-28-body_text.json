The group B genes (subtelomeric) were shown to be transcribed 0-10 hours after invasion, and turned off when the parasites reached later stages, whereas the group C (chromosome-central) transcripts were still detected 4-8 hours later than the subtelomeric genes. This differential transcription pattern was not seen here. All var genes within group A, B or C in the unselected NF54 population showed the same abundance profile regardless of promoter.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
