For these experiments, we co-expressed Histagged Lsm11 NTD with un-tagged FLASH NTD in E. coli and monitored whether FLASH NTD could be co-purified by the nickel-NTA agarose beads. The results showed that the Y73A/L76A/Y80A and K88A/K92A/K95A mutants still interacted with Lsm11 NTD, while the L118A/I119A mutant could no longer interact with Lsm11 NTD (Fig 4C) , consistent with earlier data [28] . These experiments further demonstrated that the loss of binding between the FLASH NTD mutant and Lsm11 NTD is not linked to the dissociation of FLASH dimer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
