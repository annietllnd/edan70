Furthermore, the availability of the new virus will facilitate the future development of new therapeutic interventions, such as vaccines and drugs. Figure S1 Sensitivity and dynamic range of real-time PCR in the detection of bunyavirus RNA. To evaluate sensitivity of our RT-PCR, a real-time PCR was performed. Serial dilutions of in vitrobtranscribed bunyavirus RNA sequences were tested. A wide linear range (from 5 copies to 5610 7 copies of control RNA per reaction) was detected in this assay.
