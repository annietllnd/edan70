One application presents the geographical distribution of each DENV genotype on the map in a userspecified time span. Another option is a homology search program that searches for the most homologous DENV sequence in the DGV database and show the geographical positions of closely related sequences on the map. The other interface shows the sources of imported dengue cases on the map, according to the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR), Japan (http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-e.html). This set of applications is available at the DGV web site (https://gph.niid.go.jp/geograph/dengue/content/genomemap).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
