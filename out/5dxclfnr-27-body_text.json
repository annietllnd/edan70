Nonetheless, early during HSV-1 infection, apoptosis is still blocked in an Akt-dependent manner until the virus has accumulated enough Us3 protein kinase to mimic Akt activity. However, in the absence of Us3, the virus appears to have evolved a backup mechanism to retain the activity of Akt thereby ensuring anti-apoptotic signaling [64] . Another herpes virus thought to manipulate the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway is the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Both the HCMV major immediate-early proteins (MIEPs) and a constitutive active form of Akt can inhibit temperature-induced apoptosis in ts13 cells. Since this ability of the MIEPs to inhibit apoptosis is lost when PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited by LY294002 and since MIEPs can activate Akt, it was concluded that the MIEPs induced anti-apoptotic activity is Akt-mediated [65] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
