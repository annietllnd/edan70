To knock down SGTA expression, we used siRNA from three different sources that were pools of four siRNAs (Sigma), three siRNAs (Ambion) or a single siRNA (Qiagen). One day after plating, HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nM non-target or SGTA siRNA with Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Four hours later, cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or Vpu-defective pNL4-3 molecular clones. The next day, medium was changed and the siRNA transfection was repeated. One-day later, virions were pelleted in an ultracentrifuge and cell and viral pellets were lysed 63 . In overexpression experiments, HeLa and 293T cells were co-transfected with pNL4-3 or pNL4-3delVpu in the absence or presence of tetherin and SGTA expression vectors. One-day posttransfection, virions were collected and cell and viral pellets were lysed as above. Viral proteins in cell and virus lysates were immunoblotted with HIV-Ig 63 and virus release efficiency was calculated as the amount of virion-associated Gag as a fraction of total (cell-plus virion-associated) Gag.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
