RNA was isolated according to TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) manufacturer's instructions. In brief, TRIzol reagent honey bee homogenate was combined with 0.1 ml chloroform and mixed by vortexing for 5 seconds, samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, prior to centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13,2006g in a table top centrifuge. Next, 700 mL of the aqueous phase was transferred to a new microfuge tube containing 490 mL isopropanol. Following mixing, the samples were incubated at 220uC for 20 minutes and then either centrifuged (13, 2006 g for 15 min) or further purified utilizing Zymo-III RNA columns according to manufacture's instructions (Zymo). RNA was extracted from five bees collected from the colony entrance for each of the time-course samples.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
