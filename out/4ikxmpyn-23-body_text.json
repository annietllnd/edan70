A couple of viral proteins mediate NLRP3 degradation and thus suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The EV71 proteases 2A and 3C directly cleave NLRP3 protein at residues G493-L494 or Q225-G226, respectively (73) . HPIV type 3 C protein interacts with NLRP3 and promotes its ubiquitination, thereby mediating NLRP3 proteasomal degradation (31) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
