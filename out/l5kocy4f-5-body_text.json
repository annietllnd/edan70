For example, the PPxY L-domain within eVP40, mVP40, and other viral matrix proteins interacts specifically with WW-domains of: 1) host Nedd4; a HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligase that is linked with the cellular ESCRT machinery, 2) host ITCH; a HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in immune regulation and inflammatory signaling, and 3) host IQGAP1; a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in regulating cell motility, actin polymerization, and filopodia formation [2, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In general, these previously characterized viral PPxY/WW-domain interactions promote efficient virus production.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
