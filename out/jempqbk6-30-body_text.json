{"cord_uid":"jempqbk6", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC4632390", "divid":28, "text":"The 43 envelope proteins also comprise two structural groups ( Table 2 ). The first one consists of glycoproteins of negative-strand ssRNA viruses (Rift Valley fever virus) and positive-strand ssRNA viruses (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus strain TC-83, Rubella virus, Dengue virus 2, Langat virus), collectively called class II fusion proteins. The average TM-score within positive-strand ssRNA viruses is similar to that between negative-strand ssRNA and positive-strand ssRNA viruses and is 0.67. The structural similarities ( Figure 3C ) detected among these proteins are in agreement with the similarities previously reported between flaviviruses and alphaviruses and the proposed evolutionary link between Bunyaviridae and Flaviviridae [65] . This fold is structurally similar to cell-cell fusion protein EFF-1 from C. elegans, although sequence homology is not detectable (DALI Z-scores between 4.9 and 12.3, RMSD between 2.9 Å and 12.1 Å, sequence identity between 5% and 9%, Supplementary Figure S2 ). The analogy of the fusion mechanism between the viral and eukaryotic proteins has been suggested [66] . The second structural group among envelope proteins represents an example of HGT and will be discussed in the subsequent section.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
