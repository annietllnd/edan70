In particular, host factors appear to be important determinants of disease severity and a number of specific proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are observed in severe JE cases [7] . For example, it has been demonstrated that increased levels of TNF-Î± in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum correlated with cases of severe disease [8] . However, how these biological cytokines and chemokines contribute to the severe disease has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of the specific host response in severe cases is an important priority to develop a specific treatment for the infectious disease.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
