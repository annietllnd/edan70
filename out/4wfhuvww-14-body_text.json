However, it has been proposed that frameshifting may predominantly serve to modulate RNA levels rather than to produce frameshifted proteins (Plant et al., 2004) . Evolutionary studies argue that the generation of out-of-frame proteins has been minimized by codon optimization that results in non-functional small peptides rather than functional proteins (Bollenbach et al., 2007) . However, it is becoming increasingly recognized that programmed ribosomal frameshifting can result in peptides or proteins with physiological functions (Dinman, 2012a) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
