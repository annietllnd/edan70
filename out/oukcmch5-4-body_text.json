The viral genomic RNA is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein (N) to form the helical nucleocapsid, which is surrounded by the lipoprotein envelope, containing membrane glycoprotein (M), the small envelope protein (E), as well as the spike glycoprotein (S) (reviewed in [19] ). Trimers of the CoV S protein, a type I membrane protein belonging to the class I fusion proteins, form the peplomers that protrude from the virion surface [20] . The S protein can be divided into two functional subunits. The amino-terminal S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain; while the carboxy-terminal S2 subunit contains domains required for fusion, including the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat domains (HR) HR1 and HR2, and the transmembrane (TM) domain.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
