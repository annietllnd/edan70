The primary cells were equally divided into five groups as follows: the control group (group 1), cells treated with 25 µg/ml SH (group 2), 50 µg/ml SH (group 3), 100 µg/ml SH (group 4) and 200 µg/ml SH (group 5). Group 1 was administered an equivalent amount of normal saline (NS), whilst groups 2 to 5 were treated with corresponding amounts of SH. NS and SH were administered daily for 7 days by transfer pipette. Following the final administration, the five groups of synovial cells were measured using an MTT assay for analysis of the growth inhibitory rate of SH on synovial proliferation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
