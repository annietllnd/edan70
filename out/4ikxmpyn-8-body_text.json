In an IAV infection model, juvenile mice had sustained elevated levels of type I IFNs and persistent NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suffering from severe lung injury independent of viral titer (19) . In addition, HIV-1 infected microglia are shown to cause NLRP3associated neuroinflammation (20) . HCV infection promotes chronic intrahepatic inflammation and liver injury mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome (21) . The recruitment of excessive inflammatory cells and pyroptosis-mediated cell damage take part in the immunopathology progresses (22, 23) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
