Here, we took advantage of the novel plasmid-only-based, helper virus-free RG systems for rotaviruses (28, 29) to gain new insights into the mechanisms of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and its role in viroplasm assembly and virus replication during viral infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
