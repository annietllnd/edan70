Some viral glycoproteins are capable of specifically recognizing distinct glycan motifs on the host cell surface and thereby mediate viral entry, infection, and tropism. Depending on the virus, host cell glycans can act as primary receptors, co-receptors, and/or attachment factors.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
