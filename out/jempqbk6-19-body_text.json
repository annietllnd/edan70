The key catalytic residues ( [50] , marked with arrows in Figure 2D ) are highly conserved. Thus, the proteins are probably functionally competent. The three proteins are equidistant with about 30% sequence identity. Thus, the family may have originated in any of the respective species and then spread into the others via HGT [50] , although the routes of the transfer are difficult to discern. The comparison of three-dimensional structures of influenza and Betacoronavirus hemagglutinin esterases confirms that the transfer occurred from Orthomyxoviridae into Coronaviridae, and not vice versa (see Section 3.2.2).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
