In this study, to avoid the lethal pathogenicity of the live H7N9 virus, we took advantage of a pseudovirusbased neutralization assay to evaluate the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6. Pseudoviruses expressing the NA of H7N9-AH and divergent HAs were produced in 293T cells, and the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 was tested on susceptible MDCK cells. As in the neutralization assay with live H7N9-AH viruses, HNIgGA6 neutralized the H7N9-AH pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 41.66 ng/ml (Fig. 4a) . The neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 against divergent H7N9 strains was also tested. As expected, although the H7N9-SH1 strain was resistant to HNIgGA6, the antibody could neutralize the other 11 strains with estimated IC 50 values from 36.53 to 63.47 ng/ml (Fig. 4b) . The V186G and L226Q mutations led to antigenic drift for viral HA1 and the fulllength HA protein, and the ability of the mutations to confer resistance against the mAb was also determined c The mutations G186V and Q226L restored the ability of the mAb to bind the HA of H7N9-SH1. d Viral HA and the mutated HA proteins were expressed in HeLa cells and detected via IFA using pseudovirus entry assay. As shown in Fig. 4c , when V186G and L226Q were present in H7N9-AH, the pseudovirus successfully escaped from HNIgGA6 pressure. In contrast, when G186 and Q226 were replaced by V186 and L226, the mutated H7N9-SH1 was neutralized the mAb. Taken together, these results confirmed that V186G and L226Q were responsible for antigenic drift in H7N9-SH1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
