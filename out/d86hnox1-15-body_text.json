The method can thus be used to design three, four, or even six overlapping genes. To design five or six overlapping genes (using all six reading frames at once), the coding sequence should be represented as a series of nucleotide quintets, instead of quartets. It is also straightforward to extend the algorithm to situations where one uses more than four nucleotide types, or codons that are four nucleotides long, instead of three 23 , which could be of interest in synthetic biology, or still longer codons, which could be of interest for other types of information storage. Below, we present the successful design of 200 triple genes as an illustration.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
