One of these was siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Although -with the exception of RAB7Aknockdown was not monitored at the protein level, we believe this approach firmly demonstrates the importance of novel host factors for several reasons. Validated siRNAs were used and the experimental conditions were confirmed by analyzing the mRNA expression levels of several genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, we made use of three independent siRNAs per target gene, and a target was only classified as a hit when at least two out three siRNAs showed the same phenotype. Importantly, our findings were strengthened by targeting multiple proteins per host cell pathway/complex, each time with very similar results. Moreover, hits obtained with the replication-dependent reporter assays were confirmed with our novel replication-independent enzyme complementation entry assay. Also the use of recombinant viruses differing only in their spike proteins enabled us to show that inhibition of virus infection upon siRNA transfection resulted from differences in virus entry and not virus replication. Finally, the results obtained were corroborated by using a large panel of inhibitors and by making use of haploid knockout cells, in which late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking was inhibited.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
