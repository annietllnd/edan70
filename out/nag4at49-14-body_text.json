In this system, the hinge region along with CH2-CH3 domains comprised in the crystalizable fragment (Fc) of the IgG1 molecule was directly fused to the N-terminus of the previously described glycophosphoinositol (GPI) protein ScSed1p [3] . The introduction of this fusion in yeast results in the targeting of the Fc to the cell wall. As described in Figure 1 , once this anchored fusion is co-expressed with a full-length IgG molecule, the Fc portion of the Fc-Sed1p fusion is expected to hetero-dimerize and form inter-disulfide linkages, through their respective hinge regions, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the Fc portion of the heavy chain (Hc) of the half IgG molecule. The complex interaction of Fc-ScSed1p-Fc(Hc+Lc) coupled to the association between the heavy chain and the light chain (Lc) within the antigen binding fragment (Fab) results in the display of the monovalent Hc+Lc moiety on the cell surface. The concomitant and independent association of the soluble heavy and light chain units of the full length IgG molecule would result in the secretion of fully assembled antibody molecules.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
