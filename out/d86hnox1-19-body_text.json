The similarity of the computed homologs to natural sequences from the same family as X or Y was characterized by their Blast E-values versus the Swissprot sequence collection. For each pair and reading frame, we made two predictions, corresponding to two different positions of the X′ 5′-terminus relative to Y′, for a total of 751,500 predictions. Blast hits were only counted if the match lengths represented at least 85% of the total sequence length.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
