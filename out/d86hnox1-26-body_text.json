This contrasts sharply with naive expectations based on the stringent overlap constraint. The fraction of successes obtained is only a lower bound, since we only considered one representative from each Pfam family and only two positions for the X′ 5′-terminus relative to Y′. We also observed that while our algorithm provably maximizes the similarity score S(X′, Y′), a heuristic search that does not reach the maximum can produce additional hits (in other words, maximizing S(X′, Y′) does not always minimize E p (X′, Y′)). However, our focus here was not to be exhaustive but to demonstrate that overlapping genes could be produced for close homologs of thousands of domain pairs. Since the calculation was done for 125,250 unique pairs, we expect the results are general.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
