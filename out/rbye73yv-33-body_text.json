Despite the differences in geographic location, epidemiology and immediate animal reservoirs, these two viruses share remarkable similarity in causing severe respiratory syndrome, leading to high fatality in humans and trigger serious public health concerns. With the advent of modern techniques in virology, immunology and vaccinology, we have gained substantial insights into the biology of MERS-CoV, and its pathogenesis with unprecedented speed and accuracy. As summarized in the current review, tremendous progress has been made in understanding (1) the entry process of MERS-CoV into target cells, (2) the structure and function of S glycoprotein and cellular receptor DPP4 in mediating viral entry, (3) antibody response during natural infection and isolation of broad and potent neutralizing mAbs, and (4) design and development of vaccine candidates using various innovative technologies. However, our progress in translating these discoveries into clinical application has been slow. Only two vaccine candidates and one mAb panel have entered phase I clinical trials for safety. Ironically, no vaccines and treatment strategies have been approved for SARS-CoV infection even after more than a decade of outbreak. We could not imagine how catastrophic it would be should SARS-CoV hit again or MERS-CoV continues to probe and gain strong capacity in transmission to and among humans.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
