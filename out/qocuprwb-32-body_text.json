Viral loads in brain cortex, thalamus and brainstem but not cerebellum and spinal cord were significantly higher in severe DSG mice than in mild DSG ( Figure 3A ). However, in the brain cortex, the variance of virus titer in the mild DSG mice ranged from the minimal detection limit to 10 8 pfu/g of tissue, whereas all mice exhibited more than 10 6 pfu/g of tissue in the severe DSG ( Figure 3A ). These results imply that 45.8% (11/24) of mice in the mild DSG produced high viral loads similar to those in the severe DSG. Thus, it is likely that high viral infection alone is not a critical determinant of severe disease and additional factors contribute to the fatal encephalitis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
