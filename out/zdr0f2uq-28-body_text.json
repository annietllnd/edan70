This functional constraint renders HAs not able to be completely shielded by glycans. Indeed, there appears to be a maximum number of N-linked glycosylation sites allowed on HAs at any one time, resulting in the replacement of non-conserved glycosylation sites with an alternative N-linked glycan sequon [172] . In other words, the plateauing of the number of glycosylation sites on HAs appears to derive from a balance between functionality and immune evasion.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
