The 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4Â°C with viral HA1 protein (50 ng per well). Serial four-fold dilutions of antibodies (beginning with 100 ng) in PBS were made and assayed for binding to recombinant HA1 proteins. After washing, bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antihuman IgG Ab (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 405 nm absorbance using an ELISA plate reader (Tecan).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
