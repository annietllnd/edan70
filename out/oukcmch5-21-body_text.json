Nevertheless RNAi-mediated silencing of HOPS subunits and treatment of cells with U1866A indicates that late endosome-tolysosome maturation is required for efficient entry. To confirm and extend these observations, we made use of haploid HAP1 cells lacking a functional HOPS complex resulting from lentiviralmediated knockout of the VPS33A subunit (H1-DV33 cells; [74] ).Both HAP1 cells and H1-DV33 cells were modified to stably express the MHV receptor. As a control, the H1-DV33 cells were in addition stably transfected with FLAG-tagged VPS33A (H1-DV33-fV33). The different cells expressed similar levels of the MHV receptor as determined by FACS analysis ( Figure S5 in Text S1). Expression of FLAG-VPS33A was confirmed by Western blot ( Figure S6 in Text S1). Functional reconstitution was confirmed by confocal fluorescence imaging of lysosome localization ( Figure S7 in Text S1). While in the knockout cells the lysosomes were clustered, the lysosomes were dispersed again throughout the cytoplasm in the FLAG-VPS33A re-transfected cells, as observed in the HAP1 parental cells. The haploid cells were infected with luciferase reporter gene-expressing MHV, VSV, or IAV at low MOI. Cells were lysed at 7 (MHV and VSV) or 16 (IAV) hpi and luciferase expression levels were determined. The lack of a functional HOPS complex had no effect on VSV and IAV infection; however, MHV infection was strongly reduced in the knockout, but not in the re-transfected cells ( Figure 5B ). These observations confirm the conclusion that late endosome-tolysosome maturation is required for efficient entry of MHV, a characteristic that is not shared with the pH-sensitive VSV and IAV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
