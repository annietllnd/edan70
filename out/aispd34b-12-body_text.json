A representative subset of samples that described the profile of the transcript abundances was further analysed by Q-RT PCR. In brief, 50 μl of packed erythrocytes with ~10% parasitaemia was dissolved in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of RNase-free water and treated with DNa-seI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 25 min at room temperature, followed by 10 min heat inactivation at 65°C. All RNA samples were subsequently tested in real-time PCR for contamination with genomic DNA using a primer set for the seryl-tRNA synthetase gene (Table 1) . DNA-free RNA samples were used for synthesis of cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA content was confirmed by real-time PCR using primers for the seryl-tRNA synthetase gene.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
