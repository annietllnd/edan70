The heavy-chain and lightchain genes were cloned into the antibody expression vector and expressed by transient transfection in HEK293F cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cell culture was collected 72 h later and was centrifuged to remove cell debris. Human IgG1 protein was then purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A agarose (TransGen Biotech) and was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (GE Healthcare).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
