Various approaches have been applied and more than twenty vaccine candidates have been reported in the past few years, including vaccines based on inactivated virions [62, 63] , virus-like particles [64] , recombinant viral vectors [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] , DNA [49, 81, 82] , recombinant protein subunits [33, 49, [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] , and nanoparticles [80, 93, 94] . Table 2 summarizes the critical features of these approaches and their protective potentials in experimental animal models.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
