Goblet cells are very infrequent in healthy lab mice. We deduced that any surface epithelial cell that was GFP positive and not positive for acetylated alpha-tubulin or Muc5AC was a secretory club cell. Our analysis was for the total number of positive cells and we did not further enumerate the % of ciliated cells that were positive, the % of goblet cells that were positive, etc. Figure 3 , the authors delivered the CPP-ELD peptide "once or twice over an 8hr period." Yet, in the experiment shown in Figure 4 , the authors delivered the CPP-ELD peptide "one shuttle-RNP dose/day on two consecutive days". Why use two different dosing regimens for these experiments?", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
