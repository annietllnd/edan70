Surprisingly, the Δ176-180 mutant, containing the C-terminal tail, also failed to form viroplasms in MA104 cells, despite the absence of Ser or Thr within the chosen aa 176-to-180 region. Both phosphorylation-negative mutants tested did not replicate in MA104 cells, and we could not detect any structures containing viral RNA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
