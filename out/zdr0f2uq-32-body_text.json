The Ebola virus envelope surface glycoprotein (GP) also exhibits dense glycosylation, suggesting a role in immune evasion. Ebola GP is initially expressed as pre-GP that is cleaved by furin into two subunits, GP1 and GP2, which are associated by a disulphide bridge. This heterodimer assembles into a trimer, mediated by extensive inter-subunit interactions, on the surface of nascent virions to form mature Ebola GP that is solely responsible for receptor attachment, fusion and entry into target cells [202] . Ebola GP presents approximately 17 N-linked glycosylation sequons and an extensive mucin-like domain, per protomer (Fig. 3) . Both N-linked glycosylation [112, 203, 204] and the extensive O-linked glycosylation of the mucin-like domain [38] have been shown to negatively impact immunogenicity by hiding immunogenic protein epitopes [112] . Interestingly, antibodies elicited against the so called GP-1 "glycan cap" and the mucin-like domain of Ebola GP have been characterised, although compared to antibodies that bind other epitope classes, such as the GP base, GP2-resident fusion-loop, and the GP1-head domain, neutralisation was limited [113] . It has been hypothesised that variation in neutralising potential within "glycan cap" and mucin antibodies may be due to heterogeneity in both N-and O-linked glycosylation processing states [113] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
