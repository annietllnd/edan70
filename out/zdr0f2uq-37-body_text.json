Alphaviruses and Phleboviruses have been reported to employ DC-SIGN as the primary receptor [214, 215] that recognises oligomannose-type glycans on the viral surfaces [52, 222] . Glycosylation analysis of the envelope glycoproteins of a prototypic alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), revealed near-exclusive oligomannose-type glycan populations on the E2 attachment glycoprotein, but more complex-type glycosylation on the membrane-proximal E1 fusion protein [52] . Similarly, phleboviruses of the Phenuiviridae family, such as Rift Valley fever virus and other members of the Bunyavirales order, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) [223] , display oligomannose-type glycans [224] , which are required for DC-SIGN dependent cellular attachment and entry into mammalian dendritic cells [225] . Although the exact composition of the glycans at each of the sites on the Gn and Gc glycoproteins is not understood, it has been shown that more than one site can be used for attachment [224, 226] . A glycomic study into understanding the post-translational modifications on the Gn and Gc glycoproteins of Uukuniemi virus, a relative of Rift Valley fever virus, revealed significant populations of oligomannosetype glycans, predominantly on the Gc glycoprotein of Uukuniemi virus [222] . However, the dependency of DC-SIGN and other C-type lectins [227] for infection across phleboviruses is still not fully understood, especially considering that the positions of N-linked glycosylation sites are not well-conserved across the family [228] . Dengue virus is another pathogen that utilises both the macrophage mannose receptor [229] and DC-SIGN [210, 230, 231] as putative receptors to infect macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively. Structural data using cryo-EM of Dengue in complex with the CRD of DC-SIGN revealed binding of N-linked glycan residues at N67 on two neighbouring E proteins by a single CRD [230] . Binding of DC-SIGN CRD does not result in any significant conformational changes, suggesting that DC-SIGN is an attachment receptor that mediates initial binding, prior to membrane fusion, which is triggered by pH-dependent rearrangements [232] . Nevertheless, DC-SIGN has been shown to be indispensable for Dengue infection of dendritic cells [210, 231, 233] . C-type lectin usage by flaviviruses is not limited to infection of mammals; both West Nile virus and Dengue appear to employ C-type lectins in Aedes aegypti called mosquito galactose specific lectins (mosGCTL) as ligands to promote infection of these invertebrate vectors [234, 235] . An important question remains with regards to flavivirus E protein glycosylation and their usage of lectins as receptors during viral pathogeny. Does the compositional variation in glycosylation between insect and mammalian expression systems determine the variable interactions of these lectins during different stages of infection?", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
