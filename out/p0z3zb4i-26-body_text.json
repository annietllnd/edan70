However, it is intriguing that Case 1 in our series who was on treatment with leflunomide showed a viral load (9.750.000 Geq/ml) that was 3 and 13-fold greater than the detected average (3.700.000) and median (775.000) of all cases, respectively, while the clinical course was prolonged (21 days prior to admission to hospital) and comparatively mild. Leflunomide exhibits antiviral effects against HSV-1 by inhibiting the assembly of viral capsids but not DNA-replication at dosages used in rheumatic patients [26] . It is tempting to speculate, that leflunomide might have led to the shedding of ill-assembled virions in Case 1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
