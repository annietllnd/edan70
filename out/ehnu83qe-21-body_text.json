The mean grayscale value of blank controls was measured at 117.45 ± 0.92, and the value of the purified CMV antibody was measured at 176.8 ± 3.39. Thus, the mean grayscale value of purified CMV antibody minus the mean grayscale value of blank control was 59.4 (P = 0.002). The value of the negative control was 125.9 ± 3.18. The mean grayscale value of the negative control minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 8.4 (P = 0.07). This indicated that there were specific interactions between the purified CMV antibody and the CMV-3A. Therefore, CMV antibodies in patient samples could be captured by the CMV-3A immobilized on the substrate.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
