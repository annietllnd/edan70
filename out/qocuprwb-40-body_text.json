However, high viral loads in the brain cortex appeared to be necessary for fatal outcome. Thus, we compared the inflammatory responses in the brain cortex of mice that contained high viral loads with more than 10 6 pfu per g of tissue ( Figure 5B) . Surprisingly, TNF-α KO mice exhibited significantly enhanced levels of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 in the brain when compared with the WT and IL-10 KO mice at 9 and 11 days pi ( Figure 5C and Figure S3A ). Furthermore, at 5 days pi, the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were higher in TNF-α KO ( Figure  S3B ). IL-10 KO mice also exhibited the increased levels of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 compared with those of WT mice at 9 days pi, although the differences were smaller than those between TNF-α KO and WT mice ( Figure 5C ). Uninfected mice showed some significant differences of cytokine levels between the three groups, but the levels were very low compared with infected mice and were not significant ( Figure S3C) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
