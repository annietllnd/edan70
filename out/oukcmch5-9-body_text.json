To validate these findings these proteins were subjected to a follow-up analysis using siRNA-mediated gene silencing with oligonucleotides from a different supplier than the one used for the initial RNAi screen (Fig. 1A) . The follow-up analysis included ACTR2 and ACTR3, two major constituents of the Arp2/3 complex which are important for the formation of actin branches and cell surface protrusions, as well as for the motility of several pathogens inside host cells (reviewed in [51, 52] ). Also selected were the RASrelated GTP-binding protein family members, RAB7A and RAB7B, which have been shown to be involved in endosomal maturation (reviewed in [53] ). RAB7 interacts amongst others with members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, involved in late endosome to lysosome maturation. The HOPS subunit VPS39 (reviewed in [54] ) was also found to be a strong hit in the siRNA screen and therefore selected. Other proteins included SNX1, involved in retrograde transport of cargo between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (reviewed in [55] ), VCL, inter alia involved in connecting the Arp2/3 complex with integrins during actin polymerization (reviewed in [56] ), and the Ser/Thr-protein kinase PAK1, which is activated by the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 family and is implicated in a variety of downstream effects including modulation of the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in [57] ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
