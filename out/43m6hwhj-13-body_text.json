Interestingly, in all groups PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein encoding gene was found to be highly expressed. To check the level of expression the FC was calculated and was found to be significantly different in all groups, reaching 37.15 in DAN group, 68.02 in ILI and 203.98 in BOR group. These results corresponded to the peak of viremia measured in serum by qRT-PCR [18] . Comparison of the differentially expressed gene lists indicated that 802 genes were up-regulated and 1033 genes were down-regulated in all three tested groups (Figs. 1, 2). Interestingly, the overlap including both down-regulated and up-regulated genes was significantly lower between DAN/ BOR and BOR/ILI groups compared to DAN/ILI groups.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
