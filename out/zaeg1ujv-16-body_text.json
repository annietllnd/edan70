During early infection (5 hpi), the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant produced structures resembling viroplasms that appeared smaller and more heterogeneous in shape than the regular, spherical ones produced during rRV-wt infection ( Interestingly, these structures produced by rRV-NSP5/S67A were morphologically similar to those observed during wt RV infection of MA104 cells silenced for CK1‚ê£, previously shown to be required for NSP5 phosphorylation (25) . NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-EGFP fusion proteins were also recruited to both types of these structures (Fig.  5C ), suggesting that the observed lack of phosphorylation does not affect NSP2-NSP5 interactions. Furthermore, the NSP5/S67A mutant and additional viroplasmic proteins, NSP2, VP6, and VP2 (Fig. 5D ), were all present in the aberrant structures, suggesting that they could also represent sites of virus replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
