According to our results, the percentage of seronegative pigs for H1N1pdm09 virus increased with age, and the highest values were observed in nursery and grower pigs. Overall, influenza virus circulates in the herds and may cause disease in susceptible pigs 21 regardless of age. The presence of seronegative animals in the nursery and grower phases (after reported outbreaks in these ages) suggests that influenza virus was circulating in the farms but that during the sampling, the virus was not circulating in the nursery and grower pig categories.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
