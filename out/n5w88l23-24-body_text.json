To determine what type of inhibitor dihydromyricetin is, this compound (40 μM) was included in the standard assay for dihydropyrimidinase with different concentrations of dihydrouracil. As shown in Fig 6, inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by dihydromyricetin resulted in Lineweaver−Burk plots with lines that crossed the y-axis at a similar point, which indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase. The presence of 40 μM dihydromyricetin yielded V max and K m values, kinetic constants, of 5.4 ± 0.4 μmol/mg/min and 1.6 ± 0.2 mM, respectively. Without dihydromyricetin, the kinetic constants V max and K m were 7.6 ± 0.4 μmol/mg/min and 0.7 ± 0.1 mM, respectively ( Table 3 ). The K m value obviously increased by twofold, whereas V max was only slightly affected. These findings indicated the competitive inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by dihydromyricetin; Inhibition of Dihydropyrimidinase by Flavonoids specifically, dihydromyricetin could compete with dihydrouracil for the active site of dihydropyrimidinase [43] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
