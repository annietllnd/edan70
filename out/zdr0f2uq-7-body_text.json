However, coincident with the advent of potent mass spectrometric and chromatographic techniques and the commercial availability of recombinant glycosidases, investigation of these post-translational modifications has become more feasible [45] . These advances have enabled experimental approaches including matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) and electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometry, allowing characterization of viral glycome (i.e. the carbohydrate repertoire of a specific viral protein in isolation or as presented by the pathogen). More recently, with the augmentation of biophysical techniques, namely in-line liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [46] , it has been possible to define the exact glycan structures presented at individual glycosylation sites [47] . Additionally, investigation of carbohydrateprotein interactions has been aided by the development of glycan microarrays capable of screening the carbohydrate specificity of glycanbinding proteins to immobilized and pre-defined glycan structures [48, 49] . Furthermore, advances in computational biology and sequencing technologies have also provided crucial insights into the evolution of viral glycosylation [50, 51] . These bioinformatics approaches can allow greater prediction and understanding of how viruses evolve to utilise glycosylation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
