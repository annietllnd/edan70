Interestingly, 1 of the 5 mice in the pCI-NS1 group only had 10% weight loss and quickly recovered (Fig. 6c) . The other 4 mice in the pCI-NS1 group exhibited clinical signs but less severe than the pCI group although they did not have statistical difference (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 6a) . Overall, weight loss in the pCI-NS1 group was less than the pCI control group (Fig. 6b) . At day 3 post-challenge, the pCI-NS1 group had a level of viremia similar to the pCI control group (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 7a) , but by day 7 the pCI-NS1 group had significantly less viremia (P < 0.05, ttest) (Fig. 7b) . Similarly, significantly less ZIKV was detected in spleen, uterus, lung, and brain in the pCI-NS1 group compared to the pCI control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, t-test) (Fig. 7c-f ). Histologic analysis showed that the pCI-NS1 group had less severe encephalitis compared to the pCI group (Fig. 7g) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that ZIKV NS1 was capable of conferring partial protection against ZIKV challenge in A129 mice in the absence of detectable ZIKV neutralizing Ab.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
