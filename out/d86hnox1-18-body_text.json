To annotate the A state in column k, we consider the 64 quartets on the right and select the one that leads to the maximal score, M k A ( , )  = . Q j (1) is the first nucleotide of quartet j. The pointer in each box (grey arrow) indicates by its slope which is the previous state; for example the pointer in the state G box on the left comes from state A at the very top of the k − 2 column; the pointer in the state T box comes from the G state one line above in the k − 2 column. the submitted sequence belongs to the correct SCOP family. Only the shorter protein of the pair was tested. Of the 500 natural Pfam domains, 183 had a SCOP match according to Superfamily; the Superfamily tests were limited to their predicted homologs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
