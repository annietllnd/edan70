Cytokine expression by inflammatory cells was generally weak, but all cytokines were found to be expressed by macrophages and neutrophils as well as low numbers of Kupffer cells ( Figure 2H ). Hepatocytes were shown to express all cytokines. This was seen either as a diffuse staining of all hepatocytes ( Figure 2F ,H,J) or appeared to vary in its intensity between individual cells ( Figure 2B,D) . A direct correlation between protein expression and mRNA levels was not observed by semi-quantitative assessment of cytokine expression.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
