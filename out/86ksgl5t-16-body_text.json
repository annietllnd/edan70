To confirm this disparity in the antiviral activities of IFN-λ3 and IFN-α against PEDV, IPEC-J2 cells were primed with IFN-α (1,000 ng/ml) or IFN-λ3 (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h and then infected with PEDV (MOI = 1). Consistent with our previous results, both IFN-α and IFN-λ3 substantially suppressed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, as demonstrated by measurements of the viral genomes and titers by RT-qPCR ( Figure 1A ) and TCID 50 titration (Figure 1B) , respectively. IFN-α reduced the number of PEDV genomes by 24-fold, whereas IFN-λ3 decreased the number of PEDV genomes by approximately 342-fold. The virus titers were consistent with results of PEDV genomes: PEDV titers decreased 10and 100-fold after pretreatment with IFN-α or IFN-λ3, respectively. The inhibition of PEDV infection by both IFNα and IFN-λ3 was further verified by PEDV N protein IFA ( Figure 1C) . The virus-infected cells were significantly decreased after pretreatment with IFN-α or IFN-λ3, whereas the number of PEDV-infected cells in the IFN-λ3-pretreated group was significantly decreased, as demonstrated by only a few sporadically distributed cells, compared with those in the IFNα-pretreated group. Thus, IFN-λ3 restricted PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells more effectively than IFN-α, regardless of the quantification of viral RNA, infectivity, or viral protein (Figure 1 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
