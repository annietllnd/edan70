Recent analyses of SNPs showed that human genomes contain hundreds of loci that exhibit signatures of positive selection (i.e., gene-environmental interactions) [56, 76] , and a number of these genetic variants are associated with the evolution of a variety of common traits (e.g., appearance, physiological adaptations) and pathologies in humans [76, 77, 78, 79] . Likewise, CNVs have been associated with a number of human phenotypes and diseases [80, 81] . For example, amylase CNVs were highly associated starch contents of the food among human populations [82] , whereas, CNVs at the CCL3L-CCL4L locus were associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, HIV-1 infection, and asthma [83, 84, 85] . While PSG physiology could be dosage insensitive (PSG copy number could range from 12 to 30 in normal individuals), the observation that CEACAM/PSG variations are comparable to those of genes under rapid adaptive evolution in primates [86, 87] suggested that CEACAM/PSG variation-associated changes in functional characteristics or gene expression could help determine survival and reproductive success of the carrier.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
