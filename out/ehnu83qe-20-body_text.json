In qualitative and quantitative detection experiments, significant changes in grayscale value detection areas compared to the blank control areas and the detection areas were deemed positive signals if P-value was < 0.05. If the P was 0.05, the detection areas were deemed negative signals. In comparison of the ELISA and BIE data, the results of the two methods were deemed in agreement if P was 0.05. If P was < 0.05, the two methods were deemed in disagreement. The correlation coefficient (r-value) of BIE and ELISA was calculated with analysis of correlation coefficient in Microsoft Office Excel (Table B in S2 File).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
