It involves the interaction of NSP5 with either NSP2 or VP2 (Fig. 11a) , required to make Ser67 available for CK1‚ê£ phosphorylation (Fig. 11b) . This initial step is then sequentially completed by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of other serines to generate the NSP5 "activator" (Fig. 11c) during a step dependent on the interaction of the Ser67-phosphorylated molecules with the nonphosphorylated partners in the NSP5 oligomeric complexes (Fig. 11d) . Alternatively, oligomers could be formed before the activation step (Fig.  11c= ). NSP5 interactions mediated by the carboxy-terminal tails T result in substrate activation and a fully hyperphosphorylated NSP5 (Fig. 11e) . This process leads to the assembly of viroplasm scaffolds containing NSP2 (Fig. 11f) and recruitment of VP6, as well as the other viroplasmic proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3, to assemble replication-competent viroplasms (Fig. 11g) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
