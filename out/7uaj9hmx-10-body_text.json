PRRSV was diluted in serum-free DMEM to reach a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) ranging from 0.1 to 1 depending on the experiment. Culture media was replaced by pre-warmed IMDM supplemented with 10% pig serum for all experimental groups. PRRSV infection was performed for another 2 to 48 hours depending on the experiment. All functional assays contained the following experimental groups: untreated and uninfected control (control); tulathromycin-treated (TUL); untreated and PRRSV-infected (Virus); Tulathromycin-treated and PRRSV-infected (TUL+Virus); LPS-activated; pro-apoptotic positive control (staurosporine; 3μM) (STS); or pro-necrotic positive control (0.1% Triton-X) (Trit-X) where appropriate.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
