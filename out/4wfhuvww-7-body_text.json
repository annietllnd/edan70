ODC catalyzes the production of polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine from ornithine through decarboxylation. ODC activity is terminated by the antizyme (Murakami et al., 1992) -providing an elegant mechanism for shutting down the activity of an enzyme by producing an out-of-frame antizyme from the same mRNA. This frameshifting is tightly regulated and can be enhanced by treatment of cells with polyamines (Nilsson et al., 1997) . The ODC antizyme mechanism is highly conserved throughout all eukaryotes (Ivanov et al., 2000b) . The frameshifting requires the FIGURE 2 | Main sources for out-of-frame peptides. Regular expression of this mRNA with translation initiating tRNAmet will result in expression of peptide "AUG(0)" (red). Out-of-frame peptides could arise from alternative out-of-frame CUG or AUG start sites resulting in translation of peptide "CUG(−1)" (green). Alternatively, −1 or +1 frameshift signals within the original reading frame could result in expression of out-of-frame peptides "AUG(−1)" (blue) or "AUG(+1)" (yellow), respectively.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
