We defined the initial calendar day as t 0 , i.e., day 0 of the epidemic, which was not empirically observed. We assumed that exposure among secondary and subsequent generations of human cases began to occur after t 0 . The earliest observed date of exposure was 4 August 2014, and we denoted d 0 as the gap number of days between t 0 and 4 August (i.e., d 0 = 4 August minus t 0 ). Table 1 shows the timeline of the outbreak. The index case, i.e., the first identified clinical case, had illness onset on 9 August and the confirmatory diagnosis was made on 26 August. In the present study, diagnosed cases of dengue virus fell into one of three groups. In Group 1, the exact date of exposure was known. In Group 2, exposure dates were interval censored, calling for interval-censored likelihood. In Group 3, no information was available with respect to time of exposure. Depending on this grouping, we used slightly different likelihood functions. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
