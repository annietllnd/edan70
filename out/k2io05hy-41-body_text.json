Localisation of the NS4 to the nucleoli was visible by confocal fluorescence as well as by overlaying the fluorescence signal onto cells imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy ( figure 14A, 14B) . Localisation of NS4 to the nucleoli was confirmed using anti-fibrillarin antibodies, giving a fluorescence signal that was super-imposable on that of NS4 in the nucleoli ( figure 15 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
