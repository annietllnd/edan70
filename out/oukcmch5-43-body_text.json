Using Oligofectamine (Life Technologies) reagent three independent, non-overlapping siRNAs (predesigned Silencer Select siRNAs from Ambion) per gene were individually transfected into target cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection mix for one well contained 2. qRT-PCR of siRNA-mediated gene knockdowns HeLa-mCC1a cells were subjected to siRNA-mediated gene knockdown as described above. At 72 hpi cells were harvested by trypsinization, single-cell suspension counted, and collected by centrifugation. Cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). mRNA levels of genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR using a custom designed pair of specific primers to the gene resulting in about 150 bp products. RNA levels were measured using the GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) according to the manufacturers' instructions on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). Expression levels were corrected for cell number and viability as determined by the Wst-1 assay (Roche).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
