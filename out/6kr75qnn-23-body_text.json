Cells were infected with two different MOIs, 0.1 or 0.001, and viral copies in the supernatant were detected. Upon infection, cells of both species showed cytopathic effects. Both cell lines showed high replication of VSV with maximum copy numbers in the range of 10 9 viral copies per ml and lower maximum copy numbers for RVFV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
