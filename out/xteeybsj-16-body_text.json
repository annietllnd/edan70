The serological profiles differed for both viruses and among geographical areas, suggesting a high variety of viral circulation across the state and resulting in seronegative animals that were susceptible to influenza infection and respiratory disease outbreaks. Little information is available regarding the influenza subtypes circulating in swine in the country, and because the lack of cross-protection between different subtypes is one of the obstacles preventing the development of efficacious vaccines and prevention of influenza infection in swine, more studies are needed to improve the knowledge of viral circulation and to determine the best strategies for preventing economic losses related to influenza virus infection in Brazil. Studies involving serological surveillance for the influenza virus in other regions in Brazil, detection of endemic viruses circulating in swine herds and monitoring the genetic evolution of these samples by sequencing could be useful to provide information about molecular epidemiology of SIV and provide data for vaccine production and control of influenza virus in Brazil.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
