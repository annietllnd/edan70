We demonstrated that despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/ΔT was not phosphorylated and failed to form viroplasms. We have previously shown that coexpression of NSP5/ΔT was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, while other NSP5 mutants referred to here as activators of phosphorylation, e.g., NSP5/Δ3, did (24) . Interestingly, upon coinfection with two rRVs, NSP5/S67A and NSP5/ΔT, neither of the mutated NSP5 variants were phosphorylated (Fig. 8A) (8, 19, 24, 26) . This result was supported further by infecting the MA104 transfectant cell line stably expressing NSP5-ΔT (MA-ΔT) with the rRV-NSP5/ S67A strain (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 4) . The NSP5/Δ176-180 mutant was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following coinfection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail. This result suggests that the "activator" NSP5 needs to also be hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 8C ). In MA-ΔT cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant strain, aberrant viroplasms similar to those observed in wt MA104 cells (Fig. 8E) were produced, which did not support virus replication compared to the wt virus (Fig. 8F) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
