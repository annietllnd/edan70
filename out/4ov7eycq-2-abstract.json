The vpu gene is present in HIV-1 and certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs; SIVgsn, SIVmus, SIVmon) but not in HIV-2 or other SIVs. Vpu is a 16-kDa, type I integral membrane phosphoprotein that is expressed from a bicistronic mRNA together with the Env glycoprotein 2 . Vpu contains an amino-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT). The CT of Vpu consists of two α -helices linked by a short loop. Two serine residues (S52 and S56) that undergo phosphorylation to recruit β -TrCP, a key component of the SkpI-Cullin-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, are located in the short loop 3 . Vpu is primarily localized in the ER and Golgi and also to some extent at the plasma membrane 4 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
