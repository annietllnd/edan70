They lack a cell wall (preventing staining with Gram stain) and are not sensitively detected on routine bacterial cultures. Optimal recovery requires specialized media and growth conditions. There are several human pathogens in the genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma which are responsible for a variety of clinical manifestations involving multiple body systems [1] . M. hominis causes septic arthritis and postpartum fever and has been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and bacterial vaginosis [2] . Ureaplasma species can cause acute urethritis and have been associated with bacterial vaginosis, preterm birth, and neonatal respiratory disease [1, 3] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
