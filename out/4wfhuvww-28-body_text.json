With biophysical single-molecule methods that measure these forces using optical tweezers, Hansen et al. have confirmed that unfolding of a IBV-based pseudoknot required ∼500 kJ/mol, compared to the theoretically determined 292 kJ/mol (Hansen et al., 2007) . Chen et al. have determined that a 100% confidence in −1 frameshifting is reached by an unfolding force of ∼57 pN (Chen et al., 2009) . Such single-molecule biophysical approaches may help to identify potential frameshift sequences, but as they require immobilization of the RNA, they will be technically challenging to implement on a genome-wide scale.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
