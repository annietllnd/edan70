Further, most commonly used cDNA libraries such as the ORFeome are designed to avoid expression of frameshifted peptides-for instance, by deletion of the 5 and 3 -UTR. It may, however, be possible that certain phenotypes in cDNA screening are exerted by out-of-frame proteins. In order to fish for phenotypic effects exerted by such peptides, cDNA libraries can be designed in a way that genomic fragments are inserted downstream of an AUG start codon in +1 or âˆ’1 frame so that all genomic fragments are deliberately frameshifted. A subsequent functional phenotypic screen can then identify phenotypes associated with expression of such deliberate frameshift fragments. However, there are limitations in such an approach, e.g., where to place the frameshift. Also, deliberately expressed out-of-frame proteins may have little physiological relevance.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
