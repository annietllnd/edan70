LRTIs are the leading infectious cause of death and the sixth-leading cause of death overall worldwide [1] . In 2016 alone, LRTIs (defined as pneumonia, bronchitis, or bronchiolitis) caused an estimated 2.38 million deaths with a disproportionate effect on children younger than 5 years of age and adults >70 years old [1] . Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae caused over half of these deaths in all ages, approximately 1.2 million deaths [1] . Globally, improvements in mortality rates have been seen among children <5 years old, but this is offset by increases in LRTI disease burden among people >70 years old. Typically, bacterial infections are associated with higher mortality rates from LRTIs compared to other infections [1] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
