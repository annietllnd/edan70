In order to identify the amino acids necessary for protein 3a IC activity, a set of recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing mutated 3a proteins was engineered. Amino acid substitutions were created to disrupt the IC activity of 3a with minimal impact on its three-dimensional structure, mutating residues predicted to face the lumen of the pore. As the 3a protein structure has not yet been experimentally determined, in silico models were used to select the residues potentially facing the lumen of the pore (54, 55) . As the 3a protein has three TMDs, mutants with changes to a single TMD (TMD1 Ϫ , TMD2 Ϫ , or TMD3 Ϫ ) or to two TMDs (TMD[2,3] Ϫ ) were engineered ( Table 2 ).
