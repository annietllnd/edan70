Typically, they spent about 15 minutes to respond to these questions. Six of the exercises were rated for their quality through five Likert scale questions: the overall quality of the exercise (1 = poor; 5 = excellent); the quality of the exercise discussions (1 = poor; 5 = excellent); the exercise identified important key gaps in preparedness (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree); the exercise helped participants to better understand the roles and responsibilities of agencies and organizations responding to an influenza pandemic (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree); and the exercise generated information that participants planned to use (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
