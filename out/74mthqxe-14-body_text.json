We observed that, following a 24-h incubation of 293/LH2SN cells with IFN-a2b, syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env or IAV HA was greatly reduced in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3D ). In contrast, 10A1 MLV Env-mediated syncytia formation was not significantly affected by the IFN-a2b treatment (Fig. 3D ). No cytotoxicity was observed during the 24-h IFN treatment period; nor were there any changes in the expression of JSRV Env and Hyal2, as examined by immunoblotting and flow cytometry (data not shown). Since 293 cells do not express significant amounts of IFITMs, especially IFITM1 and 3 ( ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
