In addition, biochemical studies demonstrated that ectopically-expressed FLASH can self-associate in tissue culture cells and that this self-association requires the N-terminal 200 residues [32] . These data, in conjunction with our current crystallographic study, strongly support the notion that the N-terminal domain of FLASH exists in solution as a coiled-coil dimer. We changed up to three consecutive residues in the dimer interface but failed to convert FLASH into monomers. The dimer interface of the FLASH NTD wild-type, C54S/C83A mutant, FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and Lsm11 NTD. The distributions of the proteins at concentrations of 1 mg/ml (B-D) and 0.8 mg/ml (E) are shown by solid lines and those at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml (B) and 0.05 mg/ml (D) are shown by dashed lines and that at 8 mg/ml (D) are showed by dotted line. The y-axis on the right is for the protein at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (B) and 8 mg/ml (D). The vertical dashed lines on the left and right indicate the monomer position of Lsm11 NTD and the dimer position of FLASH NTD, respectively. The residual bitmap of the raw data and the best-fit results are shown in the insets. The data are summarized in Table 2 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
