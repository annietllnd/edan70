Complete information concerning clinical presentation and routine examination was available for 190 patients (68.1% of the total), 61 of the FLU-A-positive cases and 129 of the FLU-Anegative cases. Data on the number of samples, clinical and univariate characteristics, P value and odds ratio (OR) (as well as the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) in FLU-A-positive and in FLU-A-negative cases can be seen in Table 2 . In comparison to FLU-A-negative ILI-case patients, cough was more likely to be reported in patients whose RT-PCR tested positive for influenza A virus ( Table 2) . Patients infected with FLU-A experienced more cough than patients infected with other viruses or those viruses free (x2, p,0.001). Other clinical characteristics (such as sore throat, headache) appeared to be more frequent in those infected with the FLU-A virus than those non-infected, but the difference was not statistically significant. FLU-A-infected patients presented with a mean temperature of 38.6uC [95% CI (38.4, 38.7)] which on average, commenced 1.3 days before admission [IQR [1] [2] . Approximately 30% of FLU-A-infected patients reported hyperpyrexia (temperature .39uC). The median age of patients who tested positive for influenza A was 32 years [IQR , and 44.3% were male. There was no significant difference in male and female rates. There was no difference in the neutrophil percentage between those whose RT-PCR tested positive for influenza A and those who tested negative. The clinical and univariate characteristics of influenza-A virus ILI-case patients are showed in Table 2 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
