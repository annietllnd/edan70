The significant fluorescence intensity changes over the different concentrations to the serological antibodies and three different chambers in one microchannel provide more accurate information to detect the H1N1 flu virus. In addition, the immunosensor chips were successfully applied for the detection of the H1N1 without any surface modification of microfluidic chip. The proposed integrated plastic-based microfluidic chip could provide a significant improvement in the miniaturization and a cost-effective way for bio-analysis systems. Therefore, this platform offers perspective for point-of-care testing diagnosis in various infectious disease areas.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
