To assess their roles in the antigenic drift of the virus, we constructed five mutants of H7N9-AH HA1 such that each carried one of the five corresponding amino acids present in H7N9-SH1. All the mutants were confirmed, and as shown in Fig. 3a , all five mutants retained the ability to bind HNIgGA6. Nevertheless, the V186G or L226Q mutations led to a noticeably reduced affinity. Dual mutations at V186G and L226Q resulted in complete loss of binding to the mAb (Fig. 3b ). In contrast, when 186G and 226Q in H7N9-SH1 were reversely mutated to V186 and L226, the mutants were restored in their ability to bind HNIgGA6 (Fig. 3c) . These findings were further confirmed with full-length viral HA by The mAb was immobilized on a CM5 chip, and a series of concentrations of HA1 were flowed over the immobilized mAb. Binding affinity (K D ) values were calculated using a steady-state affinity model produced with the BIAcore 3000 analysis software immunofluorescence assay (IFA) detection. As expected, the HA of H7N9-AH but not H7N9-SH1 was recognized by HNIgGA6 (Fig. 3d) . The V186G and L226Q mutations disrupted binding between the H7N9-AH HA and the mAb, whereas binding was observed when both G186V and Q226L were introduced into the HA of H7N9-SH1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
