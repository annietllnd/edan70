In particular, p38 is activated by MKK3, MKK4 [52] or MKK6 [53] , whereas JNK can be phosphorylated by MKK4 or MKK7 [54] . Dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in the conserved TxY motif (Thr-Gly-Tyr for p38 and Thr-Pro-Tyr for JNK) is essential for the complete activation of MAP kinases [49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
