The role of the translocon goes far beyond the partition process itself; it discriminates between what will or will not be a TM segment, sets the topology of the protein (based on the topology determinants present in the polypeptide sequence) and facilitates coordinated insertion of multiple TM segments.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
