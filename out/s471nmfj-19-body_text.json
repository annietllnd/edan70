Since HeLa cells are highly proliferating cancer cells with features different from the cardiomyocytes, which have limited proliferation ability after birth (Zebrowski et al., 2017) . Thus, we asked the question whether VP1 of CVB3 disturb the cell cycle of cardiomyocytes. To this end, primary cardiomyocytes extracted from the hearts of newborn Balb/c mice were transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-VP1, and cell cycle was determined. As shown in Figure 2 , EGFP was localized evenly in the entire cell, while VP1 was accumulated in the nucleus (Figure 2A) . Cell population in G1 phase was significantly increased in the cardiomyocytes expressing EGFP-VP1, compared with that of the cells expressing EGFP (Figures 2B-E) . These data show that VP1 indeed hinders the progression of cell cycle of the cardiomyocytes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
