However, there was no significant improvement in the condition of the mice or protection from death. Administration of anti-mouse TNF-α antibody also showed no improvement of disease outcome. Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that failure of TNF-α administration to improve disease outcome, may have been the result of the technical design of the experiments, different responses of TNF-α in the CNS when compared with peripheral tissues may partly explain our observations. Therefore, further investigation of the immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF-α in vivo and in vitro will be required to understand the basis of the immunopathological effects observed during JEV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
