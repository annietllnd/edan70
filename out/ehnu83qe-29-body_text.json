Samples from these patients displayed stronger signal using ELISA than BIE. In ELISAs, anti-CMV IgG molecules are detected by the addition of polyclonal specific anti-H-IgG antibodies labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In contrast, the BIE biosensor directly identified the variation of the surface anti-CMV IgG concentration after capturing target without a secondary label. Thus, this label-free method may avoid some Detection of CMV antibodies in patient serum using BIE. In the first step, CMV-3A was immobilized as the ligand on six columns. In the second step, PBST buffer was added as a blank control to six areas on the first row. Simultaneously, purified CMV antibody was added as a positive control to the last two areas on the second row. Patient serum samples were added as analytical samples on the following areas, respectively. The same serum sample was measured in two duplicate areas (No.940, 959,938 no sample, P15-9, and PBST control are underlined). interference factor. In addition, the grayscale images offered uniform areas, helping to avoid false positive signals. When the correlation coefficient (r-value) and P-value were calculated after excluding the number of severe mutations (940, 956, 964, and 984), r-value = 0.93 and P = 0.8 the statistical results showed more agreement between ELISA and BIE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
