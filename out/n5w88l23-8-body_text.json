The forward (5 0 -CGCGGCATA TGTTTGATTTACTCCTGC-3 0 ) and the reverse (5 0 -TCGCACTCGAGAAAATCGAAGGC ATGT-3 0 ) primers were designed to introduce unique NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), permitting the insertion of the amplified gene into the pET21b vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The DNA fragment was then inserted into pET21b to produce the plasmid pET21b-PaDHT for P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase expression. The expected gene product expressed by pET21b-PaDHT has a C-terminal His tag, useful for purifying the recombinant protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
