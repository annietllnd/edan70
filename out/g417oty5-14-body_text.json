Gaps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using different primers and re-sequenced by Sanger method for more than three-fold coverage. The genome ends were determined by direct end sequencing using genomic DNA as template. Given that Ion Torrent could not generate reads at long (> 14-base) homopolymer tracts, and cannot predict the correct number of bases in homopolymers > 8 bases long 49 , there may be a possibility of sequencing error in these regions. Additionally, the reported sequencing error rate for Ion Torrent was 1.78%. The number of error-free reads, without a single mismatch or indel, was 15.92% 49 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
