Mice treated with two intravenous (i.v.) doses (1 mg/kg/dose) of poly (ICLC) 8 and 48 hours p.i. showed a small increase in survival (40%) compared to untreated control mice and a single post-exposure treatment was found to be almost completely ineffective [90] . Post-exposure efficacy has been shown in mice infected with Punta Toro virus [98] and West Nile virus when treatment started one day prior to infection and continued every 48 hours until 5 days p.i. [107] . When treatments were delayed to 4-6 hours before viral challenge, efficacy was greatly reduced [107] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
