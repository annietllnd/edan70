BHK/T7-9 cells that stably express T7 RNA polymerase [50] were maintained in MEM-alpha containing 10% FCS with 600 mg/ml of hygromycin. Penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) were added to the culture media. MP-12 vaccine Lot 7-2-88 (kindly provided from Dr. J.C. Morrill at the University of Texas Medical Branch: UTMB) was amplified twice in MRC-5 cells for experiments. rMP12-PTNSs, rMP12-PTNSs-Flag, rMP12-SFSNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs-Flag were rescued from plasmid DNAs in BHK/T7-9 cells as described previously [51] , and passaged once in VeroE6 cells. rMP12-NSsR173A and rMP12-NSs-Flag were reported previously [32, 52] . RVFV ZH501 strain stock was generated after one VeroE6 cell passage of an original ZH501 reference collection vial (Serial #JM1137) at UTMB [53] . Sendai virus Cantell strain was purchased from Charles River (North Franklin, CT).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
