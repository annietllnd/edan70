The mechanisms of SPA and SPD activity in combating influenza virus infection, whether by inhibition of hemagglutinin activity [287, 288] , neuraminidase activity [289] , or promoting opsonisation of virion by alveolar macrophages [290] have been investigated. Interestingly, the gradual addition of N-linked glycan sites on HAs of H3N2 influenza viruses has been thought to attenuate viral pathogenicity, partly due to increased levels of SPD mediated clearance from the lungs [291] . Other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses [292] , and respiratory syncytial virus [293] have been shown to be targeted by these surfactant proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
