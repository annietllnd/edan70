Accordingly, in addition to its direct effects, IL-1β could have two relevant synergistic effects in FIP; stimulating IL-6 transcription and prolonging the lifespan of IL-6 mRNA [50] , thereby potentiating its effects. The similar IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA concentrations in the myocardium of young control cats and cats with FIP confirms our previous finding of a generally more reactive/inflammatory myocardium in young cats [35] , which might also contribute to the increased susceptibility of young cats to FIP, with TNF-α subsequently further amplifying the inflammatory process. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits inflammatory cytokine transcription by monocytes, but also complements IL-6 as it can stimulate antibody production [58, 59] . The host's attempt to counteract the pro-inflammatory signals in FIP through increased IL-10 expression may therefore have the negative side effect of promoting anti-FCoV antibody production.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
