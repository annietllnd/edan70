To test this hypothesis, we disrupted ERAD by depleting Bag6, a central component of the ERAD complex 45 , or treated cells with kifunensin, an inhibitor of this degradation pathway 46 . Neither Bag6 depletion nor kifunensin treatment had any effect on the accumulation of 23-kDa tetherin. These results suggest that the accumulation of the non-glycosylated tetherin species is not due to inhibition of the ERAD pathway per se. To track the fate of newly synthesized tetherin in more detail, we performed pulse-chase analysis. In the absence of SGTA overexpression, we observed that both 26-kDa (glycosylated) and 23-kDa (non-glycosylated) tetherin undergo degradation with similar kinetics, leading to a ratio of 26-kDa to 23-kDa forms that remains constant over time. However, SGTA overexpression in the presence of Vpu (but not in its absence) resulted in the much-reduced degradation of the 23-kDa form of tetherin and a time-dependent increase in the ratio of 23-to 26-kDa tetherin species. Together, these findings suggest that overexpression of SGTA in the presence of Vpu leads to the formation of a ternary complex that results in subsequent accumulation of non-glycosylated tetherin in the cytosol.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
