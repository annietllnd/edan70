One reason for the difference in the timing of delivery has to do with the different protein cargoes. In the case of GFP-NLS protein (Figure 3) , the protein half-life is around 26 hrs. To assess whether there were more GFP positive cells following GFP-NLS protein delivery, we elected to deliver the two doses of protein over a short interval (8 hours) and quantify delivery approximately 18 hr after the second dose. In Figure 4 , we delivered Cas9 RNP to ROSA mT/mG mice and quantified GFP positive cells one week after the second dose. Here the half-life of GFP expression was not a critical factor, as the cells continuously produce new protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
