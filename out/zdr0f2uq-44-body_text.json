Contact with GAGs often constitute the initial interaction between a virus and the target host cell. In the case of herpesviruses, glycoproteins C (gC) and B (gB) are known to initially bind to the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), which is a proteoglycan consisting of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and GlcNAc disaccharide repeats with various sulphate groups on the saccharide residue [268, 270] . This primary interaction of herpes simplex virus-1 to HS proteoglycans is critical and removal of HS from the cell surface, or the use of HS-deficient mutant cell lines renders the cells resistant to infection [268] . Herpes simplex virus-1 interaction with GAGs is not limited to HS; chondroitin sulfate another GAG found in the extracellular matrix, which is composed of alternating repeats of GalNAc and GlcA carbohydrates with sulphate groups, was revealed to be efficiently bound by herpes simplex virus-1, indicating multiple binding specificities to sulphated GAGs [271] . Interestingly, the mucin-like domain of HSV-1 Gc has been shown to modulate binding to GAGs, highlighting the complex interplay between viral and host glycosylation, which can be an important determinant in viral infectivity [272] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
