A recent meta-analysis of various dental caries studies in different regions of Saudi Arabia determined the prevalence to be 80% [2] . Furthermore, the observed prevalence of dental caries among children in the present study was substantially higher than the target established for the year 2000 (50%) by WHO/FDI [26] . The collective evidence from our study and previous studies confirm the endemic nature of dental caries in Middle Eastern population and signify the burden on public health.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
