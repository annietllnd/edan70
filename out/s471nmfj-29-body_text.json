In mammalian cells, the presence of growth factors promotes the expression of cyclin D, which binds and activates Cdk4/6. The activated Cdk4/6 initiates the phosphorylation of Rb, the cell cycle repressor (Moser et al., 2018) . The p-Rb releases a fraction of the transcription factor E2F, which promotes the transcription of the genes including cyclin E and A. These cyclins couple with Cdk2 which functions as a positive feedback to trigger the switch from hypo-to hyper-phosphorylation of Rb. At this point, cell commits to complete the current division cycle even without the presence of growth factors (Bracken et al., 2004) . Fully released E2F induces the production of proteins required for S-phase entry. In mammalian cells, the critical point between late G1 and the entry of S phase is defined as the R point (Moser et al., 2018) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
