To confirm that the arrest of G1 phase facilitates CVB3 replication, HeLa cells were synchronized at G1 phase through the addition of thymidine and infected with CVB3 (MOI = 1) ( Figure 7A) . Compared with non-synchronized (Figures 7B-D) showed significantly increased level of CVB3 genome ( Figure 7E) . These data indicate that G1 arrest facilitates CVB3 replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
