Therefore, we here investigated mixed VLP forming combination of M1 gene from H5 strain (A/chicken/Vietnam/ OIE-2215/2012) with full length of HA and NA genes from H1 strain (A/CA/04/2009) and constructed a VLP-forming, gene-delivering, HERV encoated-baculovirus (AcHERV-VLP) that essentially kills two birds with one stone.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
