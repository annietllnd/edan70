HeLa-mCC1a cells were treated with endocytosisaffecting agents for 30 min and then infected with luciferaseexpressing MHV (MHV-EFLM; [59] ) in presence of the inhibitors, after which the inhibitors were kept present until cell lysis. When cells were inoculated with MHV-EFLM in the absence of inhibitors, the inhibitors were added to the cells at 2 h post infection (hpi) to assess effects of inhibitors on post-entry steps. At 7 hpi cells were lysed and firefly luciferase expression levels were determined.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
