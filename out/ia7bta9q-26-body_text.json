IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and polyethylenimine (PEI) was then added slowly to 0.05% (v/v) over a 20-min period to precipitate nucleic acid. The lysate was slowly stirred at 4uC for an additional 15 min and then centrifuged for 40 min at 17,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor (Thermo Scientific). The clarified lysate was loaded onto a nickel-charged HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), followed by step elution with 300 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN 3 . Fractions containing NS5 were pooled and diluted to reduce the NaCl concentration to approximately 90 mM prior to loading onto a HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluting with a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl in 25 mM MES pH 6.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN 3 . The pooled fractions were concentrated to approximately 0.9 ml and run over a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a GF buffer of 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MES (pH 5.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.02% (w/v) NaN 3 . Pooled fractions were supplemented with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to a final concentration of 5 mM, concentrated to approximately 15 mg/mL, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280uC in 10-20 ml aliquots. The extinction coefficient of 220,615 M 21 cm 21 was calculated based on protein sequence using the ExPASy ProtParam program (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). The typical yield is 3-5 mg of pure protein per liter of bacterial culture.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
