Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that the prototypic coronavirus MHV strain A59 (further referred to as MHV) requires proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion for efficient infection of cells. By using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as by applying a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV virions to lysosomal compartments and processing of the S protein by lysosomal proteases was required for productive entry to occur.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
