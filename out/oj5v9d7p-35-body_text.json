In fact, chicken Prx proteins possess antioxidant activity; however, Prx expression in chickens is not tissue specific, showing their essential role as a housekeeping gene in all tissues to protect against oxidative damage [241] . Prx1 was found to be expressed in chicken macrophages [242] , chicken embryonic kidney [243] and chicken jejunum [226] . Furthermore, chicken Prx6 was shown to be expressed in chicken liver [244] and chicken gut [245] . Acute heat stress was shown to upregulate Prx1 and Prx3 in the small yellow follicles of layer-type chickens [246] . Therefore, in poultry Trxs, Prxs and TrxRs can function as signal transduction proteins regulating stress-induced signalling cascades. They are important antioxidants participating in cellular/organismal adaptation to stress and their upregulation is considered to be an important approach to improve stress resistance of poultry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
