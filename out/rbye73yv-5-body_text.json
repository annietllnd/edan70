It is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a helical capsid structure (Figure 1(A) ). The genome of MERS-CoV is around 30 kb (30,119nt) long and encodes 4 structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid) and 16 nonstructural proteins (Figure 1 (C)) [13] . Like other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV uses its spike (S) glycoprotein to interact with cellular receptors and enter into the target cell [19] [20] [21] [22] . As a unique structural component of the virion membrane, the S glycoprotein assembles into trimers and forms large protruding spikes on the surface of the virion [20] . The S glycoprotein is a typical type I membrane glycoprotein consisting of a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal, followed by a membrane-proximal S2 domain and a transmembrane (TM) domain [21] . The S1 domain mediates viral attachment and contains the RBD (receptor binding domain), which determines the host range and cellular tropism for MERS-CoV [23] [24] [25] . Similar to other coronaviruses, the S2 domain of MERS-CoV, mediating membrane fusion, contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) at the N-terminus as well as two heptad repeats designated as HR1 and HR2 (Figure 1 (C)) [26] . Through co-purification with the MERS-CoV S1 domain, Raj and colleagues identified that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) functions as a cellular receptor for MERS-CoV [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
