Overall, 14% of tested specimens were PCR positive for M. hominis and 52% for Ureaplasma species. A multiplex PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect M. hominis and U. parvum and urealyticum in cervical swabs from 175 Australian women with and without cervicitis; 16% tested positive for M. hominis and 68% for Ureaplasma species [15] . Multiplex PCR and autocapillary electrophoresis were used to detect M. hominis and Ureaplasma species (without differentiating U. parvum from urealyticum) in genitourinary specimens from 113 South Koreans with sexually transmitted infections; 12% were positive for M. hominis and 43% for Ureaplasma species [16] . These findings are similar to ours [15, 16] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
