First, translation, folding and modification of large amounts of coronavirus structural proteins, in particular the heavily N-link glycosylated spike protein, significantly increases the burden of the ER in infected cells. Indeed, overexpression of the spike protein from SARS-CoV [21] , MHV [20] or IBV can all activate UPR. Maturation of the spike protein could further exhaust chaperones inside the ER lumen such as calnexin, which is known to physically bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein to facilitate its proper folding [27] . Second, in order to assemble the replication/transcription complex, coronavirus induces the rearrangement of ER membrane into double membrane vesicles (DMVs), zippered ER or ER spherules [28, 29] . DMVs formation could be observed in cells overexpressing the SARS-CoV non-structural protein nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, suggesting their involvement in coronavirus-induced membrane remodeling [30] . Moreover, DMVs formed in cells infected with SARS-CoV are derived from a modified reticulovesicular network connecting to the ER, as determined by high resolution electron tomography [31] . Also, MHV may hijack vesicles originated from the ER and use the membrane for DMV formation [32] . Finally, morphogenesis and budding of mature virus particles deplete the membrane component in the ER. Assembly and budding of coronavirus virions occur in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), a membrane system that is structurally and functionally extended from the ER [33, 34] . It has been well established that depletion of ER lipid components (such as phosphatidylcholine) alters the morphology of ER and pertubs trafficking of protein cargo in the Golgi [35] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
