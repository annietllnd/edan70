Treatment options to control PRRS outbreaks are limited and the efficacy of vaccines is thwarted by the antigenic variability of PRRSV [51] . Disease severity is closely related to the ability of the virus to dysregulate macrophages functions and induce inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeting either of these components may represent a critical element of novel therapeutic approaches. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of macrolides have been well established [23-25-24] . Whether these effects may be beneficial in the context of viral diseases such as PRRS remains obscure. The present study assessed the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of tulathromycin (TUL) in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages. The findings indicate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus, in the absence of any direct anti-viral effects.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
