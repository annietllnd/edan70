However, if the peptide backbone adopts a secondary structure maximazing the formation of intra-protein-backbone hydrogen bonds, the energy penalty for the insertion will be greatly reduced [50] [51] [52] . Therefore, the formation of secondary structure (Î±-helix in the case of viroporins) is critical for membrane insertion of a TM segment. The favorable effect of hydrogen bonding is not restricted to intra-helical bonds. In multi-spanning membrane proteins the presence of inter-helical hydrogen bonds can also facilitate the insertion of an otherwise unfavorable segment [51] [52] [53] [54] . Nevertheless, intra/inter-molecular hydrogen bonds do not eliminate completely the energy penalty associated with the insertion of a peptide bond. The cost of dehydrating the peptide bond is still elevated [55] and this must be compensated by the favorable energy of inserting a significant amount of hydrophobic side chains. This phenomenon explains the commonly elevated hydrophobicity profile of TM segments.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
