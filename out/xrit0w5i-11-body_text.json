The cell lysates were centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and probed with a monoclonal antibody to β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IFITM1 (Sigma-Aldrich). After a further incubation with peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (ORIGENE). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. The relative protein level of IFITM1 to β-actin was analyzed by Image J software.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
