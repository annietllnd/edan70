We hypothesized that these compartments provide the environmental cues required for productive virus-cell fusion. In order to analyze to what extent the low pH in the endosomal system is required for entry of MHV, we analyzed the inhibition of MHV entry at different concentrations of BafA1. While high concentrations of BafA1 (as used for the results shown in Fig. 2 and 3 ) affect endosomal maturation, at low concentrations this inhibitor of vacuolar-type H + -ATPase only elevates the pH of endosomal compartments but does not affect endosomal trafficking per se [66] . We made use of that property and tested the sensitivity of MHV to BafA1 side by side with the control viruses VSV and IAV. VSV has been described to fuse at pH 6.2 in early and/or late endosomes [9, 11, 12, [67] [68] [69] , while IAV has been shown to fuse in late endosomes at an even lower pH [9, 10, 70] . HeLa or HeLa-mCC1a cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of BafA1 for 30 min prior to infection with reporter gene expressing viruses: VSV (VSVDG/FLuc-G*; [71, 72] ), IAV (IAV-RLuc; [73] ), or MHV (MHV-EFLM). Luciferase expression levels indicated that infection of cells with VSV and IAV is much more affected by BafA1, with an IC50 values of 0.80 and 0.63 nM, respectively, compared to MHV, which displays a three to four fold higher IC50 of 2.34 nM ( Figure 5A ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
