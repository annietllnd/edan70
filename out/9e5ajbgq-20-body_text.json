Barring few exceptions, almost all the factors were significantly associated with dental caries' experience in univariate analyses (step 1). In the ensuing step 2 multivariate analysis, a limited number of factors were associated with dental caries in each of the four risk domains with more concessions observed among dietary factors. In the final step of model selection, the highly collinear child feeding covariate (i.e., age of the child when breast feeding was stopped) was excluded to address multicollinearity. Our model selection process yielded 12 variables that were significant at p < 0.05 for inclusion in the final model. Although association measures were not provided in Table 2 to avoid confusion, interested readers could find these details in Additional file 1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
