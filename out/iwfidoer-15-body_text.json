Since PCR amplicons were not observed in the dsRNA-specific RNaseIII-treated sample prior to reverse transcription, most of the amplicons (cDNA) were likely to have been derived from dsRNA (Fig. S1 ). The results of the sequencing analysis indicated that 99.1% of total reads were derived from the MoCV1-A genome (Table S1 ). Five contigs obtained by de novo assembly were identical to the entire region of the MoCV1-A genome segments attained using a conventional cloning and sequencing method (44, 45) with > 99.9% identity (Table S2) . Read mapping on MoCV1-A genomes (Fig. S2) showed that the sequence coverage of terminal regions was generally higher than that of the central regions of each segment with few exceptions. No obvious relationship was observed between read coverage and GC content (Fig. S2) . These results indicated that FLDS effectively enriched dsRNA reads, thereby allowing the retrieval of complete genome sequences including terminal regions without the requirement for the additional rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
