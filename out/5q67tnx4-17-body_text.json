About 1-2 ml of nutrient broth was added to the culture swab and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Mueller-Hinton agar plates were prepared, and the samples were inoculated. Antibiotic discs were placed at specific distance, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The results were read by measuring the zone of inhibition produced by various antibiotic discs and compared to the standards.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
