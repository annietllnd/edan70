Spearman's correlation analysis performed to compare the results of both, microarray and RT-qPCR analyses, revealed strong correlation (R = 0.878225, p-value = 0.000002) between fold changes of selected genes determined by both methods (Table 7) . Such concordance between the expression values determined by two methods supports the reliability of the observed expression differences and allows accurate interpretation of obtained data. Furthermore, statistical analysis confirmed very strong correlation (R = 0.831, p-value = 0.001) between individual samples and pooled mRNA quantitation what supported the validity of the pooling strategy applied in this study (Online Resource 2- Table S2 ) [22] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
