There are a few notable examples of viruses that encode some, if not all, of the enzymes involved in the glycosylation of their proteins and other macromolecules such as, chloroviruses and mimiviruses [41] [42] [43] [44] . Although not enveloped, viruses such as rotaviruses can also exploit the hostglycosylation pathways to modify their proteins. (B) Following mRNA synthesis, the mature tri-glucosylated N-linked glycan precursor, dolichol-P-P-glycan, is cotranslationally transferred en bloc by oligosaccharyltransferase to the asparagine residue of an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon on a nascent polypeptide chain. Following transfer of the precursor glycan to the protein, glucosidases in the ER remove the three glucose residues while the protein folds in the Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle. A series of ER and Golgi mannosidases subsequently cleave mannose residues down to the Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycan. The action of GlcNAc transferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) initiates the first branch of the N-glycan. Once Î±-Mannosidase II removes the two remaining outer mannose residues, other glycan processing enzymes such as galactosyl-, fucosyl-and sialyl-transferases, can act to construct a huge assortment of complex-type glycans. (C) The mucin-type O-linked glycosylation pathway is initiated by a family of ppGalNAc transferases that covalently link a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide to any serine, threonine and tyrosine residue. Following this conjugation, a series of glycosyltransferases can act upon the primary GalNAc residue to generate the four common O-linked glycan cores. Each of these cores can be extended and processed further to generate numerous mucin-type O-linked glycans. Glycans are presented using Consortium for Functional Glycomics symbolic nomenclature and Oxford system linkages [31] , as per the key.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
