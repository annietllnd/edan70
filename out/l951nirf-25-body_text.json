Correct insertion of each gene in recombinant baculoviruses was confirmed by PCR amplification from baculoviral genomic DNA (Fig 2A) . Sf9 cellderived baculoviruses containing HA gene or VLP forming genes (AcHERV-HA or AcHERV-VLP), were transduced into 293T cells. HA protein expression in virus-infected 293T cells was detected by western blotting (Fig 2B) . Protein expression in baculovirus-infected 293T cells was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using a mouse polyclonal antibody against pH1N1 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody ( Fig 2C) . Collectively, these results demonstrate that proteins were successfully expressed in 293T cells infected with baculoviruses. Influenza VLP formation in mammalian cells was confirmed by comparing negatively stained AcHERV-VLPs with wild-type pH1N1 (positive control) using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed largely spherical enveloped particles that were consistent with the 100-150 nm diameter (Fig 2D) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
