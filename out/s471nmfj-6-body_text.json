While a direct implication of CVB3 in the manipulation of cell cycle has already been demonstrated, whether viral capsid protein VP1 exerts impact on the progression of cell cycle is unknown. In our previous study, we identified that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB3 (hereafter VP1) contains nuclear localization signal and is imported into the nucleus (Wang et al., 2012) . In this work, the impact of VP1 on cell cycle was analyzed. Our results show that VP1 arrests cell cycle at G1 phase through up-regulating the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This finding reveals a new role of VP1 in facilitating the replication of CVB3.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
