Monocytes cultivated in L929-conditioned medium showed the same morphology as those cultivated in medium devoid of L929-factors. Consistent with previous data, microscopic observation and NSE staining showed that by day 7, more than 95% cells were macrophages. Viral titers in monocytes incubated with L929 were significantly higher at 48 hours p.i. compared to viral titers in monocytes cultivated without L929 supernatant (Fig 2) . Numbers of PRRSV infectious particles were significantly elevated in MDMs cultivated with L929-supernatants at all time points of the infection (except from the 8 hours p.i. time point) versus MDMs cultivated in medium supplemented with HI-pig serum alone (Fig 2) . In L929-cultivated MDMs, PRRSV infection peaked at 24 h p.i. and declined afterwards, whereas it continued to increase at 48 hours in L929-cultivated monocytes (Fig 2) . Based on these observations, we chose to use L929-cultivated MDMs for functional experiments, unless stated otherwise.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
