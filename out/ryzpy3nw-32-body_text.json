All of the cats in group T05 were seronegative on day −1, but by day 42 three of 16 (19%) had antibody titres >90 and were considered seropositive, with a group geometric mean of 42.3. Two of these cats had antibody titres that returned to <90 by day 617, while the third had a titre if 270/90. Two cats which were negative on day −1 and 42, had titres >90 on day 617, possibly indicating a slowly developing antibody response.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
