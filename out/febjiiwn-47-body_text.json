Each pool was converted into a Blast library and queried against the entire Solexa dataset by BlastN and tBlastx. Hits with an e-value greater than 1610 23 were extracted along with their paired end, regardless of similarity. Each pool was assembled using the Geneious sequence analysis package [102] . Contigs greater than 250 nt were queried again against the dataset by tBlastx with an e-value threshold of 1610 25 . Any positive hits were then queried against the NR database with the same parameters to eliminate spurious hits.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
