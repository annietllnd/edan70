We successfully captured that impact using convolution of the incidence and the incubation period. By combining mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure, dengue control during the 2014 outbreak in Tokyo was highly successful. Should a similar event happen in the future, concerted efforts including similarly combined interventions, accompanied by identification of the location of exposure, should be implemented.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
