Overexpressed SGTA was reported to interact with HIV-1 Gag in a manner that could be reversed by Vpu. It was proposed that in the absence of Vpu, SGTA interacts with HIV-1 Gag and forms a complex that is inhibitory to HIV-1 release. In the presence of Vpu, due to stable interactions between SGTA and Vpu, the SGTA-Gag interactions are abrogated and the defect imposed by SGTA overexpression is reversed. Dutta and Tan further reported that the TPR domain of SGTA is sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 particle release 27 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
