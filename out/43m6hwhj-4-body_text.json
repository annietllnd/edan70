The virus utilizes a range of mechanisms to influence the immune response including weak stimulation of interferon production and slow development of cell-mediated immunity, inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and weak and delayed neutralizing response [13] . As a result, the course of infection may advance to a chronic stage lasting even up to 21 weeks [14] . Insufficient stimulation of an immune response and high level of genetic variability also constitute key problems in the development of efficient vaccines. None of the currently used vaccines provides full protection against infection and their effectiveness is often compromised towards heterologous strains [15] . Deeper knowledge on the core mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and the relevance of genetic diversity is necessary to facilitate the development of efficient tools for PRRS control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
