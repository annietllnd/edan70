The importance of N-linked glycosylation of envelope proteins, with respect to immune evasion, has been observed across many viruses including: Hepatitis C [133, 134] , Hepatitis B [135] , Hendra [136] , Newcastle disease [137] and Herpes simplex virus [138, 139] . Some class I fusion proteins exhibit particularly high densities of glycans, consistent with their role in shielding. Here, we focus on the glycan shields of the trimeric class I fusion proteins from HIV-1, Influenza, Coronavirus, Lassa, Ebola, and Nipah viruses (Fig. 3) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
