Flow cytometry analysis of CD3 + CD4 + cells producing Th1 cytokines revealed that only cells isolated from mice immunized with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 expressed ZIKV antigen-specific IFN-γ producing T helper cells (CD4 + IFN-γ + ) (Fig. 3b) . Six-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized with each vaccine candidate (5 mice per group). Mice were euthanized at day 35 post-immunization, the spleen was isolated from each mouse, homogenized, a cell suspension prepared, split into three wells (triplicate per mouse) and cultured in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of 20 µg/ml of ZIKV E protein for 5 days. a Proliferation of CD4+ T cells.
