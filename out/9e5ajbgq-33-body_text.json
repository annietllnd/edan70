Information from various risk domains was systematically analyzed to aid in prioritizing the modifiable factors associated with dental caries experience in children. Unlike several prior studies in this area [10, 14, 16, 19, 34] , this study addressed the issue of multicollinearity and corrected potential bias from small sample in the analysis. The comprehensive nature of information collected encompassing various risk domains enabled us to evaluate the relative importance of individual factors over socioeconomic factors, a component seldom addressed in previous studies. Our study provides much needed baseline statistics on several population characteristics to aid not only local authorities, but also international organizations (e.g., WHO) to evaluate and improve the health programs aimed at mitigating the burden of dental caries in children.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
