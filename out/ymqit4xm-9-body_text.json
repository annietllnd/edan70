Previous studies have demonstrated that TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 are important proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of RA (21) (22) (23) (24) , and that the inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 is effective in the treatment of patients with RA (25) (26) (27) . Notably, several studies have indicated that HCT was able to efficiently inhibit IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (24, 28) . In addition, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of RA by binding to cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and therefore inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Previous studies also demonstrated that HCT supercritical extract exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the COX-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway. Owing to the gastrointestinal side-effects of NSAIDs, HCT may be a better drug candidate for the alleviation of symptoms caused by RA (20) . The present study demonstrated that the synovial proliferation rate significantly decreased following treatment with SH. Furthermore, the inhibition rate of SH was found to be dose dependent. Therefore, these results suggest that SH is able to inhibit the proliferation of synovial cells from a patient with RA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
