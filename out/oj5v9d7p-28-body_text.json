Indeed, the vitagene concept was further developed and validated in relation to poultry production [13, [89] [90] [91] [92] 112, 113, 179] . Accumulating experimental evidence indicates that there is a great opportunity to nutritionally modulate the vitagene network using various nutritional supplements, including phytochemicals [176] , carnitine, [90, 180] , betaine, taurine and vitamins A, E and D [13, 181] . In fact, activation of the vitagene network by nutritional means is considered a new fundamental approach for improving animal/poultry resistance to various stresses [13, 111] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
