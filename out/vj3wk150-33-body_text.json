PKR phosphorylates eIF2α and inhibits protein synthesis, thereby rendering an antiviral effect [96] . PERK, another eIF2α kinase, usually activated by excess viral proteins loaded in the ER [2, 100] . PKR and PERK activation inhibits protein synthesis globally and curtails viral spread through inactivating eIF2α making these two kinases key players in integrated stress response to virus infection. High level of phosphor-eIF2α leads to preferential translation of transcription factor ATF4, which promotes a number of genes expression. One of ATF4 target genes is growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). GADD34 helps PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α, thereby recovering global protein synthesis. The induction of GADD34 is a canonical cellular response to counteract PERK/PKR via preserving eIF2α activity [5, 101] . A number of viruses encode viral protein mimicing the function of GADD34, helps PP1 to counterbalance the PKR/PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
