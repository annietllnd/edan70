It mostly draws the attention because it induces more toxicity than many of the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the entire "methods" section of the LDH assay could be improved. Presumably 50 ÂµL was administered in a solution of water (not PBS), but it would be helpful to state these things explicitly.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
