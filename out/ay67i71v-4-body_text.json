The gap in knowledge, as well as the poor attitudes and bad practices in relation to disease prevention and control, contribute to the increased risk of infection and negative impacts during mass gatherings [13] . The assessment of pilgrims KAP towards respiratory tract infections and their preparedness have received considerable attention from many researchers from different countries across the globe [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . To ensure effective preventive practice and optimum preparedness regarding respiratory tract infection prevention during Hajj and Umrah, data on pilgrims' knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) are required. This information would be significant in providing the needed strategies to be implemented. Moreover, these would enhance and evaluate the presently available programs as well as recognize possible interventions to improve the behavioral and attitudinal changes. Positive attitude and behavioral changes are driven by the level of knowledge and perceptions towards preventive practices [19] . However, there is no study conducted in Malaysia to assess the KAP of both Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice regarding the prevention of respiratory tract infection and to explore the relationship between the demographic variables and knowledge, attitude and practice scores among 2018 Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
