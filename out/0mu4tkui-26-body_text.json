Also, antibodies subclasses can differ; some viruses elicit a strong IgG response, while others induce a response dominated by IgA. In our antibody capture experiment, a combination of protein A and G coupled beads was used. Both proteins strongly bind to IgGs, but not or less efficient to IgA. It has been shown that serum antibodies, for instance against PIV-1 are not neutralizing efficiently, and that especially secretory IgA plays an important role in preventing re-infection [26, 27] . To address that point, protein L coupled beads, which are able to capture IgA, were tested. However, no difference was observed in the amount of PIV-1 or enterovirus capture (data not shown).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
