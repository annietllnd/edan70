As part of this effort, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was developed in the early 1970s. MVA was derived from the chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara (CVA) strain of vaccinia virus, by more than 570 passages in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells [10] . During the course of passage of CVA in CEF cells, several genes (mainly host-range and immunomodulatory genes) were lost, resulting in the severely attenuated MVA. About 15% of the viral genome was lost during passage in CEF cells, and MVA does not replicate productively in most mammalian cells [11, 12, 13] . MVA has been extensively evaluated in different animal models [14, 15, 16, 17] and in clinical trials, and found to be less reactogenic when compared with replication-competent first and second generation smallpox vaccines [18, 19] . MVA is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada, and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
