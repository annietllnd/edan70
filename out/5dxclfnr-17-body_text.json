In T-cells, for example, the single-stranded RNA measles virus blocks PI3K/Akt activity, and thereby down regulates SR protein phosphorylation and their translocation into the nucleus. As a result, a constitutively active splicing isoform of the lipid phosphatase SHIP, termed SIP110, containing intronic sequences between exon 5 and 6, is expressed. This, in turn, leads to an increase in PIP 2 levels and consequently to a down regulation of activated PI3K levels, necessary for activating T-cell proliferation [44] . In this particular case, the virus inhibits the signaling pathway instead of stimulating it, emphasizing the ability of viruses to trigger cascades in either direction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
