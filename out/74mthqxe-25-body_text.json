The exact mechanism underlying these observations is currently unknown, but could be related, in part, to the relatively higher levels of IFITM1 expression on the cell surface in 293 cells as compared to that of IFITM2 and 3 ( Fig. 1E and F) . Quantitative cell-cell fusion analysis confirmed the syncytia formation data (Fig. 5) , but also revealed that IFITM3 dramatically inhibited viral membrane fusion when COS7, rather than 293T, was used as effector cells (Figs. 4, 5 and Fig. S5 ). These results indicate that the effects of IFITM proteins on viral membrane fusion can be cell type dependent, which agrees with previous observations on viral entry [13, 15] . Because all three human IFITM proteins tested exhibited potent restriction of viral membrane fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins that have different structures (Fig. 5) , we suggest that a common physical mechanism, rather than specific interactions with viral fusion proteins, is responsible. Results from our series of experiments support this hypothesis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
