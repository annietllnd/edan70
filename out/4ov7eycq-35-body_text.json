One day posttransfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [ 35 S]Met-Cys for 30 min and washed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and removed from the dish in the same medium. Cells were split into five equal parts and incubated for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 h. Cells were spun down and lysed in 0.5% IGEPAL containing lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography 64 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
