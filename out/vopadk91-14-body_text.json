These results indicated that protein 3a IC activity was not essential for SARS-CoV replication in mouse lungs. The requirement of protein 3a IC activity for SARS-CoV virulence was studied in two independent experiments. In the first, BALB/c mice were infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15 (virulent virus control), rSARS-CoV-MA15-Δ3a (attenuated virus control), or one of the rSARS-CoV mutants TMD1 Ϫ , TMD2 Ϫ , TMD3 Ϫ , and TMD[2,3] Ϫ (Fig. 6A) , with clinical disease and survival evaluated for 10 days. All mice infected with the parental virus or the TMD1 Ϫ mutant showed disease symptoms starting at 2 dpi, and all died at 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. Mice infected with the TMD2 Ϫ mutant showed acute disease starting at 2 dpi, and 80% of the mice had died by between 4 and 7 dpi. In contrast, mice infected with either TMD3 Ϫ or TMD [2, 3] Ϫ mutants recovered from the disease with 100% survival, similarly to mice infected with the attenuated SARS-CoV-Δ3a variant (Fig. 6A ). During the experiment, viruses were recovered from the lungs of moribund mice, and the 3a gene was sequenced. No compensatory mutations restoring IC activity were identified in any case. The results suggest that the TMD3 Ϫ and TMD [2, 3] Ϫ mutants were attenuated in an IC-independent manner, since the TMD2 Ϫ mutant was only marginally attenuated.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
