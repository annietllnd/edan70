To study the relevance of protein 3a IC activity in virus replication and virulence, the following collection of full-length rSARS-CoVs with and without protein 3a IC activity was generated by introducing specific mutations into the 3a gene: rSARS-CoV-MA15-3a-TMD1 Ϫ , -TMD2 Ϫ , -TMD3 Ϫ , -TMD [2, 3] Ϫ , -Y91A, -H93A, -Y109A, -Y113A, and -Q116A. All these viruses were similar with respect to growth kinetics in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 5A) , indicating that replication was not significantly affected by altered protein 3a IC activity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
