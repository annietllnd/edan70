We prepared biotinylated peptides harboring either the EBOV VP40 WT PPxY motif (MRRVILPTAPPEYMEAI) or mutated PPxY motif (MRRVILP-TAAAEAMEAI). Both of the biotinylated peptides were fluorescently labeled and used to screen the specially prepared "proline-rich" reading array.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
