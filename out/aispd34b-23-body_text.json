This was also the case for NF54VAR2CSA ( Figure 5B ). As expected, there was no difference in the recognition of unselected NF54 by female and male sera ( Figure 5A ). The flow cytometry data confirmed published findings that VAR2CSA, like other PfEMP1, appears on the surface of infected erythrocytes several hours after the first detection of var transcription ( Figure 1B and 5B) . Surface-exposed VAR2CSA was detected by VAR2CSA-specific rabbit antibodies and female serum from a malaria endemic area about 18 hours after invasion, and the amount of PfEMP1 reached a plateau which seemed to remain constant throughout the later stages. Male immune sera, on the other hand, showed the same lack of recognition of NF54VAR2CSA as was seen in unselected NF54.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
