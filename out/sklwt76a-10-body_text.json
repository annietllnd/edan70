Analytical sensitivity was assessed by spiking a series of six tenfold dilutions of quantified genomic DNA from M. hominis ATCC 23114, U. urealyticum ATCC 27816, and U. parvum ATCC 27815D into genitourinary samples. Each dilution was extracted in triplicate and each extract was assayed in duplicate. The limit of detection was the lowest dilution where all six replicates were detected. Inclusivity and cross-reactivity were assessed using a panel organisms (Table 2) , including 16 members of the Mollicutes class.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
