On the other hand, good knowledge was not reflected by their unacceptable attitudes and practices for some variables in the present study. For instance, 26.2% of the study participants had agreed that vaccination had unpleasant side effects, despite having a good understanding of its usage for prevention. This figure was similar to the figure reported among Umrah pilgrims from Egypt (60.3%) [31] . Preventive practices did not reflect the adequate knowledge reported in this study. In practice, generally, only 16.9% of the pilgrims were shown to have good preventive practices towards respiratory tract infection. However, the majority of the respondents ensured they fitted the face mask properly before using it. Despite having awareness regarding the availability of the recommended vaccines, most of the participants were not immunized against RTIs. However, gender, educational level, previous Hajj experience, and meningococcal vaccine are significantly associated with mean attitude scores. Similarly, gender, occupation, previous Hajj experience were the only factors significantly associated with mean practice scores.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
