The viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Briefly, 250 µl of diluted supernatants were applied to confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates. The plate was agitated every 10 min to ensure proper coverage of the monolayers. After 2 h of adsorption, unbound viruses were removed and cells were washed twice with DMEM. A total of 2 ml overlay medium (0.4% agarose in DMEM) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 days before plaques formed. Agarose overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde before staining with crystal violet. Finally plaque numbers were counted and the titers of individual samples were expressed in the unit of logarithm of plaque-forming units per ml. Each sample was titrated in triplicate in each experiment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
