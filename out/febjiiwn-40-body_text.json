Select samples were Sanger sequenced directly from ExoI and SAP treated PCR product or from colony PCR of TOPO cloned (Invitrogen) gel-extracted bands. Bands produced by PCR assays for known honey bee pathogens were sequenced until each molecular weight product was unambiguously associated with either a true positive or non-target amplification of the honey bee genome or microbiome. All PCR results for the four novel viruses were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
