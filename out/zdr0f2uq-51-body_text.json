Specifically, these bnAbs are able to cross-neutralise all four Dengue virus serotypes by binding to the conserved so-called E dimer epitope (EDE) [306] . Dengue E proteins are presented on the mature virion surface as 90 repeating dimers, each of which contains the EDE that bridges the two monomeric subunits with two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites (N67 and N153). These EDE antibodies are divided into two sub-classes called EDE1, which do not require the conserved glycan at N153 for binding, and EDE2, which utilises the sugar at N153 for stronger binding as part of the neutralising epitope. Beyond the fact that these EDE antibodies possess broadly neutralising capabilities across multiple serotypes [307] , these glycan-binding EDE2 antibodies are able to also bind partially immature viral particles as well as the fully mature virions [306] . As such, the use of immunogens that elicit EDE antibodies has been proposed as an alternative route for nextgeneration vaccines due to their broadly neutralising nature [308] . An important consideration of these vaccines will be the effect of antibodydependent enhancement of infection due to the cross-reactive nature of these antibodies [307, 309] . In any case, it is likely that glycan compositions of any immunogen to combat Dengue virus will have to be carefully considered, especially when trying to elicit antibodies that target the EDE.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
