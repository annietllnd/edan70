The EV71 protease 3C cuts the NLRP3 inflammasome activation effect factor GSDMD, at 193-194 residues, instead of 275-276 residues by caspase-1 (74) . This aberrantly cleaved GSDMD product fails to induce cell pyroptosis of the infected cell and, as a result, promote viral replication and attains the objective of viral evasion. Some viruses tend to take the "retreat in order to advance" strategy to maintain their survival. The ZIKV infection is a public health emergency and host IFN-Î²-associated antiviral innate immunity is essential for the control of this viral infection. Zheng and colleagues discovered that ZIKV infection induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation and deliberately enhances its activation through the NS1 protein (75) . NS1 recruits the host deubiquitinase, USP8, to cleave the polyubiquitin chains from caspase-1 so as to inhibit the proteasomal degradation of caspase-1 and, subsequently, amplify the NLRP3 activation signal. However, although the inflammatory response is strengthened by NS1, the large amount of caspase-1 turns out to the cleavage of cGAS, the critical component associated with the antiviral innate immune response. This interplay partly reflects the complex co-evolution between virus and host and may provide potential therapeutics in the future.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
