The region C-terminal to the fusion peptide, known as FP2, has been suggested to act as the second part of a bipartite fusion peptide for SARS-CoV S 24 . Comparison of this FP2 region in the structures presented here with the MHV 19 , HCoV-HKU1 16 , MERS-CoV 17, 22 , HCoV-NL63 20 and Porcine deltacoronavirus 18,21 S structures indicates that SARS-CoV adopts a unique conformation in this region (Fig. 2) . Whereas most other coronaviruses possess two short Î±-helices with a cross-linking disulfide bond, in SARS-CoV a similar disulfide bond bridges the two strands of a beta-hairpin. The unique SARS-CoV S conformation of FP2 and the lack of cross-group sequence conservation beyond the disulfide bond in this region suggest that SARS-CoV may use a distinct mechanism of FP2 membrane insertion.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
