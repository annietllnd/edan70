We found that the change in signal intensity was consistent with the increase in CMV antibody concentration. The CMV antibody detection sensitivity levels reached 0.01 IU/mL. The grayscale values of the blank control were 124.7 ± 0.5, and the grayscale values of the dilutions as low as 0.01 IU/mL were 132.3 ± 0.1, i.e.,~6.1% greater than that of the controls (P = 0.03). Repeating these tests > 10 times, our results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the assay reached 0.01 IU/mL or less. Each variation in grayscale value was linked to a corresponding concentration of the CMV antibody over the range of 0.011-2.725 IU/mL, and the In the first step, CMV-3A was immobilized as the ligand on two columns. In the second step, PBST buffer was added as a blank control to two areas on the first row. Simultaneously, purified CMV antibody was added as a positive control to two areas on the second row. Negative serum was added as a negative control to two areas on the third row. The serial dilutions of CMV antibodies were added as analytical samples on the following rows. The same concentration was measured in two duplicate areas. Quantitative detection of CMV antibodies in clinical serum 41 CMV patients (Table A in S2 File) with quantitative results by ELISA were tested with BIE (Fig 4) . For different serum samples, the changes in BIE signal intensity were different. The comparison of results between the two methods is shown in Fig 5. Single factor analysis and correlation coefficient analysis revealed that the results were in agreement between ELISA and BIE (F = 1.38<F 0.05 = 3.96; P = 0.24>0.05, r = 0.7) ( Table B in S2 File).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
