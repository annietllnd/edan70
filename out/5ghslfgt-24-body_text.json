While the mean estimates for Guangdong are nearly equivalent across all three models, the mean estimates generated by the sub-epidemic model are significantly higher for Zhejiang. Both the GLM and Richards models predict that the provinces are nearing the end of the epidemic (Figures 3 and 4) . However, forecasts from the sub-epidemic model, which accommodates more complex trajectories, suggest a longer epidemic wave ( Figure 5) . Specifically, the sub-epidemic model forecasts for Zhejiang suggest additional smaller sub-epidemics have yet to occur, resulting in higher estimates of cumulative case counts.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
