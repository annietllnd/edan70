A total of eight sub-arrays with 60,000 distinct 60-mer probes in one slide were customized. All hybridizations involved a fluorescently-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide that was complementary to a positive control probe, which was replicated for more than 4,000 spots scattered in different zones of each sub-array. This ensured that signals appeared in every zone of each sub-array to facilitate data extraction from hybridization figures.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
