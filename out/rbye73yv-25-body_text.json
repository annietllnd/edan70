The vaccine GLS-5300 was the first to be tested in healthy human volunteers. It is a DNA plasmid encoding the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, requiring two-to-three injections delivered by electroporation [81] . The phase I clinical trial was started in 2016 at the Walter Reed Army Institute, and another phase I/II clinical trial is being conducted in Korea to test dosage safety and immunogenicity. Another vaccine candidate, MERS001, is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) containing the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein antigen [70, 71] . This vaccine only requires one-time administration of 5×10 9 -5×10 10 virus particles via intramuscular route, and the local adverse events as well as immunogenicity will be evaluated in the phase I clinical trial conducted at the University of Oxford. In addition, one more candidate vaccine has been tested in dromedary camels either for potential human use or straight into veterinary use. It explores a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector to express MERS-CoV S glycoprotein [67] . The regimen involves immunization through intranasal as well as intramuscular routes twice at a 4-week interval. The vaccinated camels demonstrated a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts in vaccinated animals upon MERS-CoV challenge. Protection against MERS-CoV infection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. As MVA has established a reasonably good safety profile in humans and induced desirable protective immunity in camels, it represents one of the potential candidates to be further evaluated in humans in the near future.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
