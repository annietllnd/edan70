Next, we tested the immunogenicity of nine recombinant viruses in mice. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with a single dose (10 6 PFU) of each recombinant virus. The DNA vaccine was used as a control. Briefly, mice were intramuscularly injected with 50 Âµg of pCI-prM-E and were boosted with same dose of pCI-prM-E two weeks later. Mice infected with rVSV exhibited severe clinical signs, including ataxia, hyperexcitability, and paralysis. At 7 days post-inoculation, two of the five mice were dead, and the remaining three mice were dead at day 10 post-inoculation. However, rVSVs expressing ZIKV antigens showed various degrees of attenuation. Mice inoculated with these recombinant viruses had mild clinical signs (such as a ruffled coat) and experienced body weight losses for 1 week, but started to gain weight by 10 days (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Overall, rVSVs co-expressing prM and E/E truncation mutants were more attenuated in mice than rVSV expressing E/E truncation alone. For example, rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E414 had significantly less body weight loss compared to rVSV-E (P = 0.021, t-test) and rVSV-E414 (P = 0.045, t-test) respectively at day 7 post-inoculation. Recombinant rVSV-prM-E-NS1 was the most attenuated virus ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Mice inoculated with this virus experienced little or no weight loss and did not display any other clinical signs. This experiment demonstrated that rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens, particularly rVSV-prM-E-NS1, were significantly attenuated in mice compared to the parental rVSV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
