Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 0.5% IGEPAL and immunoprecipitations were performed with agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibodies. After a 12-h incubation, complexes were washed with 0.1% IGEPAL, and both cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Vpu antibodies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
