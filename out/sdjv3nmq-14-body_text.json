Huh-7 and H1299 cells were infected and treated with 0-8 μM SP600125. Protein levels of total JNK and IBV N was not significantly affected by SP600125 (Fig. 5c, d) . Notably, phos-JNK and PARP cleavage both reduced dosage-dependently with increasing concentration of SP600125 in both Huh-7 and H1299 cells. In summary, when treated at <8 µM, JNK inhibition by SP600125 suppressed IBV-induced apoptosis without significantly affecting viral replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
