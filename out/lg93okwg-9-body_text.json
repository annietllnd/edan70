While the electron density did not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a disulfide bond, and the two sulfur atoms are separated by 3.4 Ã… distance in the current model, the structure raises the possibility that the observed FLASH NTD dimer might be mediated by a disulfide connection, which is unlikely to occur in the reducing environment in the nucleoplasm, the site of 3'-end processing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
