NS4 was also detected in the nucleoli (figure 16B). Expressed NS4 was abundant in the cytoplasm where it formed aggregates similar to those found in infected cells. In many cells NS4 formed spherical bodies with 0.7 and 1 mm in diameter ( figure 16A and 16B) . Similar spherical bodies were occasionally also observed in cells infected with BTV-8 or GIV (figure 17A). Staining with the lipid stain oil-red-O, showed that these spherical bodies are associations between NS4 and lipid droplets ( figure 17B and figure 18A, 18B) . These bodies were identified in BTV-8 infected cells ( figure 17B and figure 18B) , where the oil-red-O stains lipids in the centre of the droplet while NS4 surrounds the lipid droplet. Figure 18A shows cells transfected with pCI-GIVNS4 stained with oil-red-O. Figure 19 shows non-infected cells stained with oil-red-O, where lipid droplets stain with red only. Similar data were recently reported for rotaviruses, where VP2, VP6 or NSP5 were found to associate with lipid droplets [39] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
