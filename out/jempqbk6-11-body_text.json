We have considered hits only between proteins coming from viruses of different Baltimore classes, to keep only the most interesting homologs in the analysis. Significant BLAST hits that met our criteria involved all Baltimore classes (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1 ) and comprised 143 protein pairs of 78 different proteins. For each hit pair, we searched the Pfam database [27] for the corresponding family by aligning both proteins to their HMM profiles, and in each case, both proteins turned out to belong to the same Pfam family. Hence, we refer to the hits using these family names (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1 ). One hit pair did not show significant similarity to any of the Pfam family. Since both proteins are annotated as hypothetical, we did not analyze this pair further. We also do not discuss the Parvo coat N family in detail, since the similarity is borderline in this case and does not allow for reliable phylogeny reconstruction.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
