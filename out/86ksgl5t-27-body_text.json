We cloned porcine mx2 or rsad2 into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS-HA, and the transient expression of pMX2 or pRSAD2 in Vero E6 cells was verified by IFA (data not shown). As expected, pMX2 or pRSAD2 transient overexpression significantly inhibited PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells, as demonstrated by measuring the viral RNA (Figures 8A,C) and PEDV N protein expression by IFA (Figures 8B,D) . Thus, these data indicate that the differentially upregulated pMX2 or pRSAD2 serves as an important IFN-位3elicited antiviral host factor against PEDV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
