Small rod-like crystal was obtained in initial rounds of crystallization screening. The growth condition and strategy were optimized to yield crystals that are at least 100-micron in each dimension. The structure was solved through comprehensive molecular replacement trials using multiple search models derived from the flavivirus MTase and RdRP crystal structures [8, 20] . The unit cell contains three NS5 hexamers (trimer of dimers) in the H3 space group (Table 1) , and the asymmetric unit comprises a NS5 dimer with the two molecules arranged in a pseudo two-fold symmetry ( Fig. S1 A/B in Text S1). Despite the observation of the oligomeric forms in the crystal lattice, JEV NS5 primarily exists as a monomer in gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S1C in Text S1).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
