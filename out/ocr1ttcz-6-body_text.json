We recovered a panel of rVSV expressing ZIKV prM-E-NS1, prM-E, E, E truncation mutants, and NS1. These mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates were highly attenuated but remained effective in triggering ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immunity in mice, and provided complete protection against ZIKV challenge in immunocompetent BALB/c and type 1 interferon receptordeficient A129 mice. In addition, we found that NS1 protein plays a regulatory role in ZIKV-specific T cell response, and that NS1 alone can confer partial protection from ZIKV infection. Collectively, this mtdVSV-based vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate for ZIKV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
