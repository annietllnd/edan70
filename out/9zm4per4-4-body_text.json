Nor is persistence length (or Kuhn length) used to learn the flexibility (rigidity) of RNA structures: neither alone nor incorporated with swelling. Evolution shows a general selectivity for folding sequences [12] , therefore, it should be able to select sequences that make use of this 59 to 39 folding process (during transcription) to insure that the native state is found efficiently. Modeling techniques should be able to take advantage of this feature of biological RNA.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
