Cell counts were carried out on 50 randomly chosen fields of 0.2 mm 2 from tissue sections from these blocks. The results are given as the number of positive cells per 0.2 mm 2 . Identification of different types of immunolabeled cells was based on morphological features, location and size of the cells.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
