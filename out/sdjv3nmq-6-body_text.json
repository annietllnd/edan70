Similarly, although ectopically expressed FLAG-MKK4 was highly phosphorylated, it actually reduced IBV-induced JNK phosphorylation compared with vector control. Although phos-JNK was only marginally increased in FLAG-MKK7-tranfected IBV-infected cells, phos-c-Jun level was significantly higher than vector control. Thus, overexpressed FLAG-MKK7 was functionally active and promoted phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun induced by IBV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
