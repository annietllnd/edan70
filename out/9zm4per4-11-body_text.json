The pseudoknot linkage stem (see Text S1) can be predicted at effectively any convenient time after the secondary structure is folded in such examples. Thus, in a 59 to 39 progressively folding scenario, these structures appear to be tuned to fold correctly and can easily catch the pseudoknot at the minimum free energy. There appear to be many classic pseudoknots that tend to follow this pattern of folding. Vsfold5, by utilizing this folding heuristic model, easily reveals this feature in many pseudoknots.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
