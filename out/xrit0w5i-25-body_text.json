The results showed that transfection with IFITM1 CRISPR activation plasmid upregulated the expression of IFITM1 in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 8a, b) . Compared to control group, the virus titers were significantly decreased by 55.72 ± 7.53% (P < 0.05, t-test) in BEAS-2Bs transfected with IFITM1 CRISPR activation plasmid (Fig. 8c) , the virus titers were significantly decreased by 52.76 ± 1.02% (P < 0.05, t-test) in HUVECs transfected with IFITM1 CRISPR activation plasmid (Fig. 8d ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
