Cells were lysed with lysis buffer [120 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue] and stored at −80 • C until analyzed. 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. Proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane and detected with corresponding primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were imaged with FluorChem R system (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA). Primary antibodies against cyclin E, p27, Hsp70, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), β-actin, GAPDH, and β-tubulin were obtained from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL). A monoclonal mouse anti-enteroviral VP1 antibody (clone 5-D8/1) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used to detect CVB3 VP1. Polyclonal antibody against 3D pol of CVB3 was prepared in our laboratory. Antibody against pS326-HSF1 was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
