On the other hand, IL-2 and IL-4 levels in TNF-α KO mice were significantly higher than those of WT and IL-10 KO mice during mock infection ( Figure  S4A ) and following JaOArS982 infections ( Figure S4B to D) . Also, the level of IL-5 in TNF-α KO was decreased compared with WT and IL-10 KO mice at 5 days pi ( Figure S4B) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
