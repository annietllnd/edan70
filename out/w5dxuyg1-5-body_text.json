We therefore first hypothesised a role for hepatocytes in cytokine production, as these have already been shown to be active in the disease. In cats with FIP, hepatocyte produced acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and in particular alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) have been shown to be elevated; to the extent that they are considered key elements of the diagnostic process [22] [23] [24] . Although not thus far studied in felines, human and murine hepatocytes have also been shown capable of producing cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-Î± [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Additionally, our group has previously identified constitutive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by feline cardiomyocytes, which increases in systemic inflammatory disease [31] . This led to the second hypothesis that the heart is an additional source of cytokines and thereby contributes to the systemic inflammatory status that allows FIP lesions to develop.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
