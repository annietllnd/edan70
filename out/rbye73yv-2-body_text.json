One of the most well-known examples was the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the winter of 2002 and 2003, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2] . In distinct contrast to the mild human coronaviruses HCoV-229E [3] , HCoV-OC43 [4] , HCoV-NL63 [5] , and HCoV-HKU1 [6] , infection with SARS-CoV frequently resulted in severe symptoms including fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. Transmission of SARS-CoV was primarily from person to person and most cases occurred in health care settings lacking adequate infection control precautions [2] . The SARS outbreak had severe consequences in 29 countries and regions, infecting 8096 people worldwide with a fatality rate of approximately 10% [7] . There are still no vaccines or therapeutics specific to SARS-CoV available 16 years after the SARS outbreak. It is not hard to imagine how catastrophic it would be if SARS-CoV were to hit the human community again.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
