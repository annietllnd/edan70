Infection with PRRSV may sensitize pigs to secondary bacterial infection. It was shown that expression of FcγRIIB was up-regulated post-infection with PRRSV strains HN07-1 and BJ-4 but an expression of FcγRIIIA receptor was inhibited, what in consequence could suppress the phagocytosis of granulocytes [79] . On the other hand, FcγR-mediated activation of monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) is a potent mechanism of HIV-1 suppression [80] . The activation of Fcγ Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes pathway after BOR and ILI infection may reflect the host attempt to control viral replication. Although the whole pathway is in an inactivated state in the DAN-infected group, we observed up-regulation of Fc gamma receptors (subtypes FcγR1A, FC = 3.7).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
