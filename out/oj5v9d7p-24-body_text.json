It is proven that HSP expression can be effectively regulated by nutritional means, including vitamins E, C and D, carnitine, betaine [13, 113] and some phytochemicals such as silymarin [91] . Indeed, these vitagenes (HSP70 and HO-1) are important elements responsible for adaptation of poultry to various stressors by maintaining cell proteostasis", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
