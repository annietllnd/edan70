However, HCV p7 and PV1 2B have recently been found, to a minor extent, associated with the mitochondrial membrane [20, 21] . In this review we will focus, exclusively, on the pathways that leads to the insertion of viroporins into the mammalian ER membranes and those ER-derived membranous organelles. For complete reviews on mitochondrial protein biogenesis see: [22] [23] [24] . However, the principles and forces that govern TM helix-helix packing are expected to be the same in all membranous compartments including the mitochondria.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
