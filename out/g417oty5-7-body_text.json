Although seemingly antiquated when compared with genome sequencing, REA profiles are still helpful to compare the unsequenced but previously reported genome types and strains 1 . The genome types of all seven HAdV-7 isolates were determined by comparing REA profiles from both in silico (Fig. 3A) and agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B) with other HAdV-7 genome types reported earlier 1 . Isolates OP01_2011, IP01_2010, IP02_2011, and IP05_2012 were chosen as representatives for in silico REA (Fig. 3A) ; IP01_2010 and IP06_2012 were chosen for agarose gel electrophoresis REA (Fig. 3B) . The REA profiles of HAdV-7 prototype strain Gomen and HAdV-7d strain DG01_2011 were chosen as references. According to the genome type denomination of Li, et al. 33 , all of these seven strains are identified as HAdV-7d (Fig. 3) , evidenced by the REA patterns and identical with the first reported HAdV-7d [33] [34] [35] , as well as with the re-emergent HAdV-7d strains DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 1,7,15 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
