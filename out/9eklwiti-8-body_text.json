Consortia have developed interpretative cut-offs for CRP levels to assist physicians with antibiotic prescribing. CRP levels ≤ 20 mg/L indicate a self-limited LRTI for which antibiotics are not needed, and CRP ≥ 100 mg/L indicate severe infection for which antibiotics should be prescribed [17, 18] . CRP levels between 21 and 99 mg/L are more challenging to interpret and must include further clinical assessment (Table 1) . Table 1 . C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels and need for antibiotic therapy [18, 19] . Although rapid tests for CRP are used in point-of-care settings, the use of CRP has been controversial. A Cochrane review of trials conducted throughout Europe and Russia determined that CRP levels may reduce the use of antibiotics but the results did not affect patient outcomes, and suggested that increased hospitalization due to CRP evaluation may occur [20] . Although Andreeva et al. reports a decrease of 36% in antibiotic prescribing with the evaluation of CRP, the authors discuss multiple studies that have not resulted in such changes [21] . Therefore, the utility of CRP levels remains specific to individual treatment settings, and the measurement of CRP is not a substitute for clinical assessment and follow-up, which remain main-stays in the assessment of LRTIs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
