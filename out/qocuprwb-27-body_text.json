Thus, we next examined the cytokine levels in the brain cortex to compare the immune responses. The levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10, but not IL-4 and IL-5 were significantly higher in JaTH160infected mice than in JaOArS982-infected mice ( Figure 1E , Figure S1A ). The cytokine levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10 were very low or undetectable in mock-infected mice and in infected mice at 5 days pi ( Figure 1E ). Corresponding to the viral loads, histopathological examination showed that a large number of neurons displayed JEV antigens and severe cuffing was observed in the brain cortex of JaTH160-infected mice at 9 day pi ( Figure 1F ). JaOArS982-infected mice also exhibited JEV antigen-positive neurons and cuffing, but at lower levels than those observed in JaTH160-infected mice ( Figure 1F ). Mock-infected mice showed no JEV antigen-positive neurons or inflammatory reactions ( Figure 1F ). These results confirm that during the early phase of infection, JaTH160-infected mice developed severe encephalitis with extensive neuronal infection which contrasts with the less extensive neuronal infection induced in JaOArS982-infected mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
