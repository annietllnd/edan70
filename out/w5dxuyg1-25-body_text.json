Interestingly, this was owing to lower relative transcription levels for IL-6 in healthy cats than of the other cytokines (though the difference was not statistically significant), whereas in cats with FIP, IL-6 levels were on a par with those of other cytokines. IL-6 was also the only cytokine that varied depending on the presence or absence of effusions; its transcription was significantly higher (p = 0.04) in cats with effusions than in those without (Table 3) . For IL-12 and TNF-α, a close to 100 fold increase in relative transcription was seen between cats with and without disease, whilst the smallest quantitative difference was found for IL-1β and IL-10; for both cytokines, mRNA levels were only~10 fold higher in FIP.
