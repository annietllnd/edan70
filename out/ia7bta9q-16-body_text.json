The first region, named RdRP interacting module herein, consists of residues 112-128, and plays a critical role in the intra-molecular interactions with the RdRP region ( Fig. 3 and details below) . The second region comprises the last three residues G263-T264-R265 of the MTase and is highly conserved in all flaviviruses (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the linker region next to the GTR residues exhibits high degree of sequence variation (Fig. 3C ). G263 and R265 form a total of seven hydrogen bonds with the rest of MTase, while T264 forms two hydrogen bonds with RdRP (Fig. 3B) . Due to its critical location in the MTase-RdRP interface and critical position in linear sequence, we postulate that it may serve as a ''pivot'' in the establishment/ disengagement of RdRP-MTase interactions observed in the fulllength structure (Fig. 3 and discussed below) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
