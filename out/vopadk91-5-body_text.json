The highest titers were reached at 2 dpi, and the titers decreased in all cases by between 5-fold and 40-fold at 4 dpi, with the parental and Δ8a viruses achieving the highest titers in lung tissue (around 10 8 PFU/g at 2 dpi and 2 ϫ 10 7 PFU/g at 4 dpi). However, compared to the parental virus, titers were reduced by 1 and 2 log units in the case of Δ3a and ΔE virus, respectively. Interestingly, the decrease in virus titers after SARS-CoV-MA15-Δ3a infection was greater in vivo than in vitro. Thus, proteins E and 3a were shown to be critical for both in vitro and in vivo virus replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
