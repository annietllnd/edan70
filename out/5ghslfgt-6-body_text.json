We collected reported case data each day at 12 pm (GMT-5) from the initial date of reporting, 22 January 2020, to 13 February 2020. We then forecasted the trajectory of the epidemic in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, which have exhibited a high burden of COVID-19. We did not fit the data or forecast the epidemic in Hubei, as the recent change in the reporting criteria resulted in a significant jump in reported cases on 13 February 2020. The impact of the new reporting criteria in this province will require a detailed analysis before the data can be fit by our current models.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
