This is in line with the fact that ORF8 was lost during the SARS-CoV pandemic and that viruses lacking this gene were recovered from patients who died from SARS-CoV infection, supporting the idea that it is also not required for virulence in humans (65) . However, viruses lacking 8a protein when 3a protein was also deleted had titers 10-fold lower than those seen with the parental virus, indicating that simultaneous deletion of the two proteins may contribute to replication to at least a small extent.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
