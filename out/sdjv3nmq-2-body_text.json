For example, p38 phosphorylation during IBV infection upregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 17 , while ERK1/2 is activated and plays a pro-survival role in ER stress-induced apoptosis during IBV infection 18 . JNK phosphorylation was detected in cells infected with MHV or SARS-CoV 19, 20 , and in cells overexpressing the N, 3a, 3b, or 7a protein of SARS-CoV [21] [22] [23] [24] . JNK and Akt are required for establishing persistent SARS-CoV infection 25 . In cells overexpressing the SARS-CoV spike protein, JNK phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C epsilon 26 , and the expression of IL-8 depends on the activity of AP-1 27 . However, detailed mechanisms of JNK activation during coronavirus infection and its involvement in coronavirus-induced apoptosis are largely unknown.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
