On one hand, the human population is becoming ever mobile and exposed to an increasing number of pathogens. On the other hand, translating basic discoveries into preventative and treatment applications has been exceedingly slow. Among many plausible reasons, a lack of incentives in financial returns perhaps stands the tallest. The deadlock is not just happening to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but also to many other infectious pathogens such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, highly pathogenic avian influenza, HIV-1, and so on. Fundamental and drastic changes have to be made in the entire research and development system before we can truly prepare and position ourselves ahead of deadly epidemic and pandemic. Only then, can our speed and accuracy in basic discovery be timely translated into clinical and public health needs. The time to act is now.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
