Sections of throat swab specimens were randomly selected and periodically shipped in an icebox to the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for virus isolation and confirmation of pH1N1. Further isolation and sub-typing of FLU-A was performed in 190 samples. Virus isolation was processed using MDCK cell lines, and positive results were followed by the haemagglutination inhibition test using reference antisera (as recommended by the WHO manual: http://www.who. int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/whocdscsrncs20025rev.pdf). Once a negative or decreased reaction to the reference antisera occurred with the isolated virus, RT-PCR and sequencing was used to clarify the infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
