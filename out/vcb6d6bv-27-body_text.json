Its genome comprises eight RNA segments. Segment seven codes for the matrix 1 protein (which forms the viral protein coat) and by RNA splicing the M2 protein [82] . Following attachment (via the hemmagglutinin protein) the virus is endocytosed. The acidity of the endosomal compartment triggers two crucial processes. First, the low pH promotes a conformational change in HA, exposing the fusion peptide and subsequently the merging of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. Second, protons from the endosome are transfered into the virus via the M2 channel. Internal acidification of the influenza A virion is responsible for disruption of the viral coat protein-protein interactions, allowing the viral genome to be released into the host cytoplasm. Later in the life cycle, the M2 channels counteracts the acidity of vesicular compartments of the exocytic pathway in infected cells protecting the structural integrity of the acid-sensitive glycoprotein [83] . M2 viroporin also promotes budding of the mature virus from the cell surface by the active generation of negative Gaussian membrane curvature [84] . In all these processes the correct formation of M2 quaternary structure is essential.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
