Although recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs gene in the S-segment encodes a negative DIVA marker [45] ; i.e., a lack of anti-NSs antibody response, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFNcompetent MRC-5 cells. The Phlebovirus genus consists of the sandfly fever group including serologically distinct Punta Toro serocomplex, Naples serocomplex, Icoaraci serocomplex, Frijoles serocomplex, Sicilian serocomplex, RVFV, and the Uukuniemi group [46] , and some of the different phlebovirus NSs are reported to be able to interfere with the host type-I IFN system [34, 47, 48] . In this study, we developed recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs of Punta Toro virus Adames strain (PTV) (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs [46] . It should be noted that a lack of MP-12 NSs serves as a negative DIVA marker to identify animals exposed to wt RVFV, and we did not attempt to identify vaccinated animals by detecting antibody specific to anti-PTV NSs or anti-SFSV NSs. We characterized the functions of those NSs, and determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs in the outbred CD1 mouse model. Our results suggested that rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, while both are as efficacious as parental MP-12, and also did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to RVFV NSs. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is an alternative candidate vaccine which can be amplified in MRC-5 cells and encodes a negative DIVA marker.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
