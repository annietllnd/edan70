The microfluidic system has four main parts: a sample plate, multi-cell array, micro-channels and pumps. A multi-cell array was formed when a polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) pattern mold contacted the surface of a silicon substrate, each cell having an inlet and an outlet for solution passage. The physical size of each cell was~1.5×1×0.5 mm 3 . The inlet micro-channels were placed into sample plate, and the outlet micro-channels were connected with pumps (ISM939, ISMATEC, Switzerland. www.ismatec.com) offering negative pressure. The simple channel junctions can be used in serial or parallel formats to simultaneously analyze single or multiple samples.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
