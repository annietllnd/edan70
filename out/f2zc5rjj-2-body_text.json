The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that more than 16,000 cumulative deaths were reported from 213 countries due to H1N1 in February 2010 [2] . Several laboratory diagnostic methods have been developed to monitor the outbreaks of the virus as follows: (1) specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection method, (2) isolation of H1N1 influenza virus, (3) detection of 4-fold rise of neutralization antibodies to the virus [3, 4] . However, these methods require highly skilled-personnel and expensive laboratory instruments. In addition, they are not suitable for undeveloped countries because of the limited access to central laboratories and expensive costs.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
