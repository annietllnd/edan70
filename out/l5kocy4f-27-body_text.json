However, in contrast to our findings with VP40, BAG3 primarily exerts positive effects on the lifecycles of these other viruses. For example, Gout et. al [63] reported that the adenovirus penton base protein interacted with the WW-domain of BAG3 via its PPxY motif to promote adenovirus entry and virus progeny production.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
