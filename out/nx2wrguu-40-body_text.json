Considering the published length of the EIP [38, 39, 47] , with summer temperatures in metropolitan Tokyo above 30˚C in August, a mean generation time of about 2 weeks is regarded as a reasonable length or slightly shorter than the temperature-dependent estimate. Our estimate was consistent with an empirical estimate by Siraj et al. [48] , indicating that a mean generation interval of 17 days occurs with the highest probability at 30˚C, although the estimate was obtained for Aedes aegypti and not for Aedes albopictus, the latter of which is abundant in Japan. The mean incubation period of 5.8 days is also consistent with the literature [37] , and we attained a finer estimation than that of Ishikawa et al. [30] ; those authors used only known 67 intrinsic incubation periods for the estimation (with an estimated mean of 6.3 days), potentially resulting in a biased estimate of the variance owing to small sample size.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
