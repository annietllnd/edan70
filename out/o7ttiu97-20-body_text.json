Our study, however, shows that progressing inflammatory infiltrates on histology in the studied time period after acute influenza infection corresponds to radiologic trends. Additionally, our study demonstrates spatial progression with increased size and number of abnormal foci in the lung parenchyma during acute infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
