HAdV-7-positive inpatients had lower white blood cell count (6.85 vs. 12.95 × 10 9 cells/L; p < 0.001), platelet count (188 vs. 273 × 10 9 cells/L; p = 0.007), hemoglobin levels (95.08 vs. 108.6 g/L; p = 0.001) and serum calcium levels (1.92 vs. 2.24 mmol/L; p < 0.001) than the inpatients infected by other types (Table 5) . On the contrary, the lactate dehydrogenase levels (940.8 vs. 429.5 IU/L; p = 0.037), the morbidity of hyponatremia (36.4% vs. 23.1%; p = 0.022), and the albuminuria rate (45.5% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.003) were found significantly higher in the HAdV-7 group than the other group.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
