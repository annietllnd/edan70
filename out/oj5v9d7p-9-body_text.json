Firstly, there is an attempt to decrease free radical production by decreasing oxygen availability, reducing the activities of enzymes responsible for ROS/RNS production (e.g., NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase), keeping iron and copper bound to proteins and preventing their participation in new radical formation. Secondly, maintaining the integrity of mitochondria, the major source of free radicals in biological systems, is of paramount importance. Thirdly, scavenging free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, vitamin C, GSH, coenzyme Q) and detoxification/decomposition of the free radicals and non-radical toxic products (SOD, GPx, catalase, etc.) are important steps in the antioxidant defence strategy. Fourthly, the system of vitamin E recycling (ascorbic acid, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), vitamins B1 and B2) which helps maintain vitamin E in an active form can increase its biological antioxidant potency. Fifthly, redox signalling, transcription factor (Nrf2) and vitagene activation and additional synthesis of protective molecules possessing antioxidant and detoxification activities are the main elements of the anti-stress strategy. Sixthly, enzymatic systems, responsible for damaged molecule repair (heat shock proteins, HSP; methionine sulfoxide reductase, Msr; DNA-repair enzymes; etc.) and removal (phospholipases, phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX (PH-GPx), proteasomes, etc.) play an important role in preventing the accumulation of damaged molecules and maintaining proteostasis. Finally, apoptosis, autophagy and other processes dealing with terminally damaged cells to remove them and prevent damages to be transferred to other cells/tissues are important elements of the antioxidant defence network.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
