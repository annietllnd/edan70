We and other research groups previously reported that porcine IFN-λ results in better suppression against PEDV infection compared with IFN-α and that IFN-λ3 more efficiently inhibits PEDV than IFN-λ1 (21) (22) (23) . However, the mechanisms underlying the difference among  IFN-λ1, IFN-λ3, and IFN-α in inhibiting enteric coronavirus  remain less clear. Previous studies have largely focused on the  gene profiles induced by human or mouse IFN-λ1 and IFN-α, but the IFN-λ3-and IFN-α-elicited genes have not been compared. In this study, we comprehensively compared the transcriptional profiling of IFN-λ3-and IFN-α-induced genes in a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) and verified the RNA-Seq results by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in vitro, and further confirmed the transcriptional profile difference in crypt-derived porcine enteroids.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
