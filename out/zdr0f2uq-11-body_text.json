For example, in the transmission of insect-borne viruses to mammals, the founder virus will display features specific to invertebrate glycosylation whilst subsequent virions manufactured in the new host will contain mammalian glycosylation. Thus, viral glycosylation undergoes a compositional switch upon inter-species transmission that will influence the interaction with immunological receptors and responses which will also influence viral tropism. Invertebrates display chiefly paucimannosidic structures [66] , thus for insect-borne diseases such as Dengue and Zika, these structures may affect lectinutilisation, infectivity, and tropism depending on the origin of viral replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
