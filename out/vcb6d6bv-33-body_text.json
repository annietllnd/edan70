In a first step viroporins insert into the membrane individually, using a pathway determined by their specific sequence and structural characteristics. In a second step, viroporins homo-oligomerize forming higher order structures crucial for the porating activity. Viroporins have been previously classify into two classes according to the number of TM segments in the protein. However, this apparently simple classification contains highly interesting features [10] . A close analysis of their sequence characteristics reveals a different mechanism of membrane insertion (step I) and oligomerization (step II) for class I and II viroporins. These differences might arouse not solely form the type of pore formed but also from the distinct viral genome organizations. Since viroporins are emerging targets for drug design, to fully explore anti-viroporin compounds as potential therapeutical agents we must significantly increase our understanding of their mechanism of action, their route to the membrane and their oligomerization requirements.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
