They present peptides derived from intracellular proteins to enable immune tolerance and immune surveillance. MHC-presented out-of-frame peptides were discovered in the early 1990's (Shastri et al., 1995) and have enabled the unbiased identification of endogenous frameshifting in mammalian cells long before the technical advances of MS. However, it is technically challenging to use this approach as a systematic tool for the identification of genomic out-of-frame peptides.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
