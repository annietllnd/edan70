As described in the previous report [16] , the DNA fragments encoding the H1N1 viral surface antigen (H1a) were amplified by PCR with forward primer (5′-CCATGGCATATGGG CCACCATCACCATCACCACGGCAA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGCTACG CACTTTTTCATACAGGTTTTTAACGTTGCTATCGTGATAGCCGCAAGCTTGTCGACA-3′) for the construction of 6His-GBP-H1a fusion gene. Then, the PCR product was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI fragment of pET-6HGBP to make pET-6HGBP-H1a.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
