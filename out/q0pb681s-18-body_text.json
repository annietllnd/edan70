It has been reported that upregulation of hnRNPH causes a decrease in HIV virion production [40] . Interestingly, it is worth noting the involvement of hnRNPH expression with TNF-α production [41] and NF-κB activation, both proteins being involved in inflammation and immune response. In Hepatitis C virus infection, it has been proposed that hnRNP might limit the amount of viral RNA genomes available for incorporation into virus [42] . These changes in expression could be significant and add information to the only described interaction between the ASFV p30 antigen and hnRNPK in Vero infected cells [43] . The authors suggest that the interaction hnRNPK-p30 could contribute to the host cell shut-off and represent a possible additional mechanism by which ASFV down-regulates host cell mRNA translation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
