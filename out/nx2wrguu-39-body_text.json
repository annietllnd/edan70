This notion is supported by our model comparisons in which both ε 1 and ε 2 were required to act as free parameters, to better describe the observed epidemic dynamics. Of these interventions, mosquito control and raising public awareness were not sufficiently effective to break the chain of transmission, as they maintained R t >1, although the reproduction number exhibited a decreasing trend due to decrease in the observed incidence. Although mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was very intensive, DENV-positive Aedes were detected after these measures had been implemented [34] . To fully halt virus transmission, the combined effect of mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure was needed for a substantial reduction in R t ; this joint reduction effect was estimated to be 44%-88%. Therefore, according to our model results, we can conclude that control of the dengue outbreak at local level in Tokyo was essential to describe the empirically observed data and successful in reducing transmissions. It should be noted that the park closure effect includes not only the prevention of exposure among susceptible visitors but also removal of infectious hosts, including local residents of the park, from the focal area of transmission.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
