In the case of HSV-1, which possess eight structural glycoproteins featuring O-linked glycosylation, viral expression in a cell line that only displays truncated Tn and sialylated Tn antigens resulted in severely reduced viral titres [35] . Whilst the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, it is conceivable that correct processing and elongation of O-linked glycosylation is integral for either viral glycoprotein trafficking, stability and viral particle formation, or infectivity [35] . Nlinked glycosylation of HSV-1 glycoproteins has also been shown to play a significant role in intracellular trafficking and folding [78] . We direct readers to the review by Bagdonaite et al. which covers glycosylation of herpesviruses thoroughly [95] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
