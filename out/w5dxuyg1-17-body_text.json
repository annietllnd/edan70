From the final elute of 12 µL of RNA, 8 µL was used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an integrated DNase step to remove traces of genomic DNA. This was followed by target specific pre-amplification using the primers described above and the TaqMan ® PreAmp Master Mix (2 ×) (Applied Biosystems™) to produce sufficient cDNA for qPCR analysis. The pre-amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using 20 PCR cycles. The resulting product was then diluted 1:20 and used for all RT-qPCR reactions as described above.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
