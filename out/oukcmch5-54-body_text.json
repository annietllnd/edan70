After 3 h of infection supernatant was replaced by fresh infection medium and infection was allowed to progress over a period of 24 h. Every 3 h a small sample of the culture supernatant was collected and immediately frozen. The samples were subsequently analyzed in TCID50 assays on LR7 cells and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to quantify virion production. Therefore viral RNA was extracted from the samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The relative amount of viral RNA present was determined with a LightCycler 480 using LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis kit (Roche Applied Biosciences) and specific primers and probe targeted against the MHV 1b gene by comparison with a standard curve.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
