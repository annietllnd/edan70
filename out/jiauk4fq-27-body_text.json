Thus, in the negative control calves, this Ab prompted positive granular immunostaining among sheathed capillary cells, free in the interstitium and occasionally in MΦs cytoplasm. However, in the inoculated groups, clusters of immunostained granular material were observed in blood vessels. Moreover, numerous IMΦs and periarterial MΦs, together with some PAM, were swollen and displayed an intense positive granular and cytoplasmic reaction in both inoculated groups between 4 and 7 dpi (Figure 2A, 2B) . In the BVDV/BHV-1 group, clusters of platelets were observed from 1 dpi, being more evident throughout the study associated with MΦs engulfing platelets that peaked at 4 dpi (score value of 3 in all evaluated fields) ( Figure 3 ). Subsequently, the positive reaction in MΦs and vascular lumina diminished considerably without recovering thereafter ( Figure 2C ). There was a significant difference in the presence of platelet clusters in this group throughout the study (p = 0.0119). In the BHV-1 group, these findings were observed from 2 dpi with similar values to the co-infected group, decreasing the number of platelet clusters until the end of the study (Figures 2D  and 3) . However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of these clusters in the lungs of animals infected only with BHV-1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
