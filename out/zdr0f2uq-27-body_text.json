The surface glycoprotein HA exists as a trimer of hetero-dimers that is synthesised as a single polypeptide (HA0) that is subsequently cleaved into the receptor binding HA1 domain and the membrane-fusion mediating HA2 subunit by host cell proteases. Similarly to HIV-1 Env, HA is a class I viral fusion protein (Fig. 3) and plays a vital role in viral entry by binding to host receptors via the receptor binding site (RBS) located on HA1. As the main focus of the immune response, HA evolves at the highest rate compared to other influenza viral proteins [171] , and the presence and acquisition of N-linked glycosylation sites on HA plays a crucial role in immune evasion [172] . The evolution of the HA glycan shield constitutes an important defense mechanism by masking neutralising epitopes [173] . In 1968, H3N2 HAs possessed an average of 6 N-linked glycosylation sites per protomer. Since then, H3N2 HAs have acquired and retained over twice as many sites, with current strains exhibiting approximately 13 PNGs per HA1-HA2 protomer [7, 172] . Similarly, from the Spanish flu in 1918 to its temporary departure from human circulation in 1957, H1N1 strains have incorporated between 1 to 3 Nlinked glycan sites per HA1-HA2 protomer [50, 174] . Interestingly, the seasonal accumulation of glycans on HAs are most-commonly incorporated at the globular head domain (HA1), in regions of variability where the majority of antigenic sites lie [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] , seemingly due to the preference of neutralising antibodies to target the RBS-proximal regions [172] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
