When RNA can chose between a single straight stem and a group of stems that fold back on themselves, there is a good chance that the latter will be selected because of the increased interaction between neighbouring (parallel) stems. For example, structures such as the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron show P5 folded back onto P4 [19] . This folding can bring an otherwise distant free strand into proximity with a pseudoknot forming structure (Fig. 4d) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
