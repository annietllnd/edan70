The envisaged fragment-warhead activation assay is based on the idea that a templated ligation reaction of a protein-binding fragment with an electrophilic warhead should lead to the accelerated irreversible inhibition of the protein, if a reactive protein nucleophile is present (Fig. 1) . In this concept, a nucleophilic small-molecule fragment binds to a binding site of a protein (Fig. 1a, step 1) . The protein-binding fragment undergoes a reversible ligation reaction with a bis-electrophilic protein-reactive group (warhead) 21, 22 (step 2). The ligation reaction thereby positions the second reactive electrophilic functionality of the warhead at the active site of the protein inducing an irreversible, covalent reaction of the active-site nucleophile with the warhead (step 3) resulting in the irreversible deactivation of the protein. The described reaction sequence enables the testing of combinations of nucleophilic fragments and electrophilic warheads in a biochemical assay and inhibitory fragment combinations detected in this 'warhead activation assay' are blueprints for the construction of potent irreversible enzyme inhibitors.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
