Terms introduced were "oxidative eustress", referring to low-level physiological oxidative stress, and "oxidative distress", referring to high-level oxidative stress [99] . The concept is graphically summarized in Figure 2 . ROS are produced in physiological conditions as a by-product of energy production in mitochondria and as an important "weapon" in phagocytes. The antioxidant defence network is responsible for maintenance of low basic levels of ROS by scavenging and converting them into non-toxic products and other mechanisms (for details, see Figure 1 ). Low levels of ROS interact with specific targets and play important roles in redox signalling (i.e., oxidative eustress). Working closely with various transcription factors and vitagenes, these ROS are responsible for stress adaptation, homeostasis and health maintenance. High exposure to ROS due to the presence of compromised antioxidant defences or excessive ROS production as a result of high stress conditions affects unspecific targets (damaged PUFAs, proteins, DNA, etc.) and causes oxidative distress leading to disruption of redox signalling. This contributes to pathophysiology and leads to compromised immunity and decreased resistance to various diseases and the decreased productive and reproductive performance of poultry.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
