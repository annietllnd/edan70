{"cord_uid":"4ov7eycq", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC4840321", "divid":1, "text":"The small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein α (SGTA) contains three TPR domains, a 34-amino acid structural motif consisting of eight loosely conserved amino acid residues that form antiparallel α -helical hairpins and serve as scaffolds to mediate protein-protein interactions. SGTA is a ubiquitously expressed co-chaperone that binds directly to Hsp70 and Hsp90 22 . SGTA also interacts with the androgen 23, 24 , glucocorticoid 24 and progesterone receptors 24 , and negatively regulates their activity. Knockdown or depletion of SGTA enhances receptor activity, whereas its overexpression suppresses receptor function 24 . SGTA was identified as a cellular binding partner for several viral proteins: HIV-1 Vpu [25] [26] [27] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 7a 28 , Rec protein of human endogenous retrovirus K 29 , and NS-1 of parvovirus H-1 30 . The TPR domain of SGTA was shown to interact with these viral accessory proteins. SGTA is reportedly involved in several cellular functions including cell division, apoptosis, intracellular transport, molecular co-chaperoning, and virus assembly and release. Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of SGTA in a variety of cancers (reviewed in 31, 32 ) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
