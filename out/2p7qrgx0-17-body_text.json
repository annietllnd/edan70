PCR performed to detect human bocavirus tentatively identified in sera from FTLS patient samples amplified a 291-bp fragment of the NS1 gene, as described previously [29] . Amplified products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
