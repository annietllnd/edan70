MERS-CoV encodes two proteins, E and 5, homologues of the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins, respectively. While the IC activity of MERS-CoV E protein has been previously described (15) , the potential IC activity of protein 5 is yet to be studied in detail. However, due to its similarity to SARS-CoV 3a, HCoV-229E 4a, and PEDV 3, IC conductance by this protein is expected. Furthermore, both the MERS-CoV E and 5 proteins have a putative PBM at their carboxy terminus, similarly to the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
