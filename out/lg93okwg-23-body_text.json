This α-helical fold might also extend to residues 53-70, encompassing the LDLY motif, but this region is unlikely to contribute to the dimerization interface. Our [33] , which showed that residues 75-136 underwent slow H/D exchange, indicative of extensive secondary structure in this region. Residues 58-62 exchanged significantly faster than the 75-136 region but slower than the directly surrounding sequences, suggesting the presence of a more dynamic secondary structure in the vicinity of the LDLY motif [33] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
