Ticks from China Camp State Park in Marin County had the highest observed infection rate of 22% (7/33) for this organism. The bacterium was detected in ticks collected throughout the state with detections in ticks collected in Aliso & Wood Canyons Wilderness Park in Orange County and at Patrick Creek in Del Norte County in the far northern part of the state. The PCR/ESI-MS signature of this novel bacterium was similar to that of A. phagocytophilum ( Table 3) . Given the breadth of coverage provided by the primer pairs used in the PCR/ESI-MS assay, this signature is consistent with the detection of a novel Anaplasmataceae species. Three representative tick samples containing this signature (samples CP-1, MR-9, and CC-14 from Napa, Placer, and Marin Counties, respectively) were selected for DNA sequence analysis. We also selected for sequencing one of the three ticks positive for A. phagocytophilum (sample MR-23 from Placer County) for sequencing. The four loci sequenced, the 16S rRNA gene, gltA, groEL and rpoB, were chosen to clarify the relationship of the novel species with named Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia' species.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
