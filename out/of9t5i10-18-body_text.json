Coronaviruses are transmitted by aerosols of respiratory secretions, the fecaloral route and mechanical transmission. Most viral growth occurs in epithelial cells, however, organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart, eyes or other cell types (i.e. macrophages) may occasionally be infected. Most infections are localized to the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract causing a mild, self-limited disease (classical 'cold' or upset stomach), occasionally causing enteric infections (primarily in infants <12 months), and rarely causing neurological syndromes. Coronavirus infection is very common in children, less common in adults, occurs worldwide and exhibits a strongly seasonal incidence of infection. Re-infections recur throughout life, implying multiple serotypes (at least four are known) and/or antigenic variation, hence the prospects for immunization appear bleak.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
