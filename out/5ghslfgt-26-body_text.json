Thus, we point readers to the sub-epidemic model predictions specifically, which suggest that another smaller wave of cases is in process. If the observed decline in case incidence is true, the predictions likely reflect the impact of the social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. In the best-case scenario, the model forecasts based on the current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
