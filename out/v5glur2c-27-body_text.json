In the present study, the MSCs showed elevated adipogenenic differentiation ability at cellular and molecular level in ON + group as compared with ONgroup. The histological evidence showed increased lipid deposition including larger fat cells number and fat deposition area in ON + group as compared with ONgroup. These suggested that the accumulation of marrow fatty tissue might come from the differentiation of MSCs [6] . At the same time, the local blood perfusion function in ON + group was significant diminished at a time-dependent pattern. Bone marrow lipid deposition would affect blood per- A B C fusion function even to ischemia [17, 18] . These evidences showed the elevated adipogenesis of MSCs was associated with steroid-associated ON occurrence.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
