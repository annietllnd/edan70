The hyper-phosphorylation of Rb is critical for G/S transition (Johnson and Skotheim, 2013; Fisher, 2016) . However, we have no evidence concerning the phosphorylation status of Rb through determining a single phosphorylation site (serine 780) of this protein. Thus, data from the present study are not sufficient for us to reach the conclusion whether or not R point passage is achieved in the cells expressing VP1. Evidence has shown that at early G1 phase, Rb is mono-phosphorylated by cyclin D-Cdk4/6. At the later stage of G1 phase, cyclin E-Cdk2 complex inactivates Rb by hyper-phosphorylation (Narasimha et al., 2014; Fisher, 2016) . These observations suggest that cyclin E, in combination with Cdk2, plays a crucial role for the hyper-phosphorylation of Rb and the entry of S phase. Moreover, studies in recent years support the concept that the mechanism, which controls S-phase entry when cells are under stress, might be very distinct from that of the normal cycling cells (Johnson and Skotheim, 2013) . Our data demonstrate that the level of cyclin E was reduced in the cells expressing VP1, while p27 kip1 was accumulated. These results suggest that lack of cyclin E and/or the accumulation of p27 kip1 are sufficient to induce G1 arrest. In consistent with our findings, previous study has shown that the accumulation of cyclin E occurs after the passage of R point and before the entry of S phase (Ekholm et al., 2001) , indicating that adequate level of cyclin E is critical for S phase entry. Evidence also shows that E2F is not sufficient to induce G1/S transition without cyclin E (Duronio and O'Farrell, 1995) . Therefore, declined cyclin E level in the cells expressing VP1 would at least contribute to G1 arrest.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
