Different concentrations of inhibitor were tested at least as duplicates and the pseudo-first-order association kinetics (k obs ) were determined using GraphPad Prism. The slope of a plot of the different k obs values against the inhibitor concentration yielded k inact /K I .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
