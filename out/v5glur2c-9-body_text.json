Briefly, rabbits were placed and fixed in supine position after anesthesia. Preliminary sagittal and oblique axial images were obtained to define the local longitudinal axis. The contrast-enhanced dynamic MR pulse sequence used previously established ultrafast T1weighted gradient-echo sequences (turbo-field echo; Philips). A total of 200 dynamic images were obtained in 90s. A bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.8 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly administered automatically via the right ear vein, immediately followed by normal saline flush. Signal intensity (SI) was then measured in the regions of interest (ROIs) over the target site beneath the joint space in the mid-coronal T1-weighted images. The signal intensity values derived from the ROIs were plotted against time as time-intensity curve (TIC) using the Gyroview software system (Philips). The baseline value (SIbase) of the SI in a TIC was calculated as the mean SI value in the first three images. The maximum SI (SImax) was defined as the peak enhancement value at a given time interval of 90s after contrast injection. Perfusion parameter was calculated namely: "Maximum enhancement". "Maximum enhancement" was defined as the maximum percentage increase (SImax-SIbase) in SI from baseline (SIbase). The perfusion parameter was calculated according to the following equation:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
