After preloading with FDG, cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors for 30 min at 37uC, after which cells were inoculated with MHV-aN in the presence of the agents, and analyzed by FACS as described above. As controls we included protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), MHV fusion inhibitor peptide HR2 (HR2, [20] ), MG132 and BrefA. Fusion of MHV was not affected by the solvents or CHX, the latter confirming that this assay is independent of RNA replication and protein synthesis. MHV fusion was barely affected by replication inhibitor BrefA, whereas MG132 had a clear negative effect, in agreement with the conclusion drawn previously that MG132 inhibits entry of MHV as well as RNA synthesis [61] . Inhibition of endosomal maturation by NH 4 Cl, BafA1 and Chloq ( Figure 3B , deep sky blue) or of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by Chlopro, Mon, and Dynasore ( Figure 3B , dark blue) severely inhibited MHV fusion. Disturbance of the actin cytoskeleton by EIPA or by LatA, CytoB, or CytoD reduced fusion by 75-80% ( Figure 3B , dark orange), while interference with microtubule polymerization by Noc had a smaller effect ( Figure 3B , orange). Late endosomal maturation arrest caused by U18666A reduced fusion to approximately 10% ( Figure 3B , turquoise). In conclusion, the replication-independent fusion assay confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and of endosome maturation for entry of MHV. The data indicate that late endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for efficient entry and fusion.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
