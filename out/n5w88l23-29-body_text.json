Some flavonoids are ATPase-inhibiting agents and competitors for ATP-binding proteins [27, 32] . For example, several flavonoid derivatives have been developed as therapeutic agents for cancer [21] . Myricetin and scutellarein strongly inhibit the ATPase activity of nsP13 of the SARS coronavirus helicase [44] . Myricetin, luteolin, and morin inhibit the hexameric replicative helicases, and myricetin inhibits Gram-negative bacteria growth [45] . Myricetin also inhibits bacterial allantoinase and dihydroorotase [15] . Given that myricetin is also a potent inhibitor of numerous DNA and RNA polymerases and telomerases [46] , these flavonoids, especially myricetin, may be a competent dirty drug or multi-target drug [43] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
