Pathway analysis performed with up-regulated genes demonstrated that one pathway was common for all groups (Agranulocytes Adhesion and Diapedesis), and another two canonical pathways were the same in ILI and BOR groups (Granulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis, Leukocytes Extravasation Signaling) ( Table 3) . Interestingly the top pathway in both ILI and BOR group was the same (Agranulocytes Adhesion and Diapedesis), while in DAN group Acute Phase Response Signaling was the top process involving the highest number of up-regulated genes. On the other hand, when down-regulated genes were analysed, two pathways were common in all groups DAN, ILI and BOR (EIF2 Signaling and Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K Signaling), one (Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling) was identified in DAN and ILI groups and another one mTOR signalling process was noted in DAN and BOR groups (Table 4 ). Additional analysis was performed to determine top 5 canonical pathways involved in immunological processes (Tables 5, 6 ). Most of the top canonical pathways involved in immunological processes were the same as in previous analysis. Agranulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis were the pathways involving the highest number of up-regulated genes in ILI and BOR groups, but was also second on the list in DAN group (Table 5) . Two pathways observed to be common only for BOR and ILI group were: Granulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis and Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling. Production of Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages was the process noted as common between DAN and BOR ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
