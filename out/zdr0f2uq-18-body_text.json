Consequently such viruses have evolved carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes to facilitate efficient viral budding and release. The most notable example is the ability of neuraminidases of influenza viruses to cleave sialic acid residues on the host cell surface to negate the ability of hemagglutinins (HA) to bind the host-cell receptor sugars [96, 97] . During virus budding at the cell membrane, HA spikes continue to bind virion particles to sialic acid residues on the cell surface until the sialidase activity of NA removes the terminal sugar residue. Additionally, NA cleaves sialic acid residues from the glycoproteins on the virus envelope itself and enhances infectivity by preventing aggregation of virus particles [98] . Furthermore, NA is thought to act upon sialic acid residues on mucins to gain access to epithelial cells, potentially playing a secondary role in aiding virus entry to host cells [99] . Additionally, a variety of paramyxoviruses, including mumps [100] , parainfluenza [101] , and Newcastle disease [102] viruses possess hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoproteins that both bind and cleave sialic acid residues, as such these viral glycoproteins are integral for facilitating host cell entry and egress [103] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
