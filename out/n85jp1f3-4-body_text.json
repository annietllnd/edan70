These are serious diseases that can be fatal, lack proven effective treatments, and have unknown and potentially long-term complications. Interestingly enough, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also acknowledged their predictions of diseases most likely to emerge as epidemics may not be accurate by including a "Disease X" in their priority list; Disease X "represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease" [8] . Notably, in 2013, Zika virus was a pathogen thought to cause only mild disease in humans and was not seen as a disease that could lead to a devastating epidemic.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
