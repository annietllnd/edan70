The average daily charge for a contract raiser from birth to weaning was $1.88/day [16] . Based on our calculated total cost for rearing pre-weaning calves, this would create a significant loss for the contract raiser. But in the Wisconsin heifer raising survey the cost per day of fixed and variable costs, which most closely matches our model, $2.05-$8.73 for minimum and maximum daily cost [8] . This simulation model can be compared to surveys to validate the results are reflective of on-farm total values. Finally, this model can be used to estimate other housing situations other than the ones presented in the current survey, and herd numbers could be used to estimate heifer costs for individual herds. In this survey, we chose the most common management practices to raise dairy heifers in North America, but there are many other options of housing and feeding dairy heifer calves that require further investigation.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
