Forty-eight hours later, a second round of transfection with siRNA was performed. After 48 h, cells were transfected with pTM-NS3-5B using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). The coverslips were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed in PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at RT. After being washed three times with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. Then, the coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with either Alexa Fluor ™ -(488 or 568) goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor ™ -(488 or 568) goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. After being washed, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Prolong ™ . Antifade (Invitrogen) and examined with a laser scanning confocal Zeiss LSM 780.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
