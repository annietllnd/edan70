Some genotypes have been abundantly sequenced and deposited in the public database, whereas other genotypes have rarely been sequenced (i.e., DENV-1 genotype II was reported in only seven records from 1960 to 2012, DENV-4 genotype III was also reported in only seven records from 1997 to 2001, and DENV-3 genotype IV has not been reported since 1977). These rare genotypes may have become minor populations or may be undergoing a silent transmission cycle (Lanciotti et al., 1994; Chen and Vasilakis, 2011; Santiago et al., 2012) . Fifteen years' worth of data from 2000 to 2014 for all serotypes showed that DENV sequences were primarily reported from South to Southeast Asia, Central to South America, and the countries of Oceania (Figure 1A) . Some biases in DENV serotype compositions were observed in several countries. For instance, the dominant serotypes were DENV-1 and -2 in Mexico, DENV-1 and -4 in Polynesian countries with the exception of Fiji, and DENV-2 and -3 in Pakistan. In contrast, all serotypes were sampled in Brazil and Thailand.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
