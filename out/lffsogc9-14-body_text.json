The resulting nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared with the S1 gene available from GenBank. Nucleotides taken from GenBank were used for alignment and tree construction, including genes that represent each IBV lineage according to Valastro et al. [16] , Indonesian isolates from Wibowo et al. [17] , and LX4 (AY189157) and Israel variant 1 (AF0937940), to illustrate well-used QX and 4/91 variant sequences. The genes used in the analysis are listed in Table-2 ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
