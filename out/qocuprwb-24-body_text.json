Subcutaneous infection with JaOArS982 did not lead to a normal dose dependent curve of mortality ( Figure 1A ). The mortality rate was not significantly increased when challenge doses ranged from 10 2 to 10 6 pfu per mouse, although the infectivity in the mice increased sequentially ( Figure 1A ). On the other hand, JaTH160 infection exhibited a dose dependent mortality curve and the infectivity in the mice was consistent with the mortality ( Figure 1A ). These observations indicate that individual JaOArS982-infected mice exhibit a variable prognosis independent of virus challenge dose, whereas all JaTH160-infected mice died.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
