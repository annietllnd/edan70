These proinflammatory cytokines presented differences in magnitude and kinetics between single and dual infections. TNFα-positive septal MΦs were associated with sites of inflammation in the BVDV/BHV-1 group (Figure 6A ), showing only a slight peak at 2 dpi (p < 0.008), whereas the BHV-1 group presented a longer response of this chemical mediator in peribronchial areas (from 4 dpi; p < 0.0001) ( Figure 6B ). On the contrary, IL-1α-reactive septal MΦs were significantly different between both infected groups before BHV-1 inoculation (0 dpi BHV-1). BVDV/BHV-1 group calves maintained lower numbers of IL-1α-positive septal MΦs throughout the study (Figure 6C) , showing a delayed response to BHV-1 inoculation (from 7 dpi onwards). By contrast, BHV-1 group calves displayed an early increase of this cytokine associated with peribronchial areas (at 2 dpi; p < 0.007) ( Figure 6D ). The number of PAM positive for studied cytokines was low in both inoculated groups, presenting only a slight response at the end of the study, with the exception of an IL-1α peak in the single infected group between 1 and 2 dpi (Figure 7) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
