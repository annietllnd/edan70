Procalcitonin (PCT) is another acute phase reactant associated with bacterial infections. PCT increases within 2-4 h of infection, peaking at 24-48 h. PCT is used to assist in the diagnosis of sepsis and has since been used for LRTIs and post-operative infections. Like CRP, its use has been targeted to ensure appropriate antibiotic use (Table 1) . Typically, PCT is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid and by the neuroendocrine cells of the lung and the intestine in small quantities and is a precursor to calcitonin which regulates calcium and phosphate in the blood, but bacterial endokines and cytotoxins stimulate its production early in the disease process. Evidence has shown that PCT is a useful method in guiding the initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTIs [22] . A meta-analysis of 32 randomized studies with a majority of patients with acute LRTIs showed that PCT testing lowered mortality (decrease of 1.4%), antibiotic consumption (2.4 day mean reduction in exposure), and antibiotic-related adverse events (decrease of 5.8%) [23] . Briel et al. evaluated 458 patients whom the physician thought needed antibiotics for a respiratory tract infection [24] . Patients were randomized to PCT-guided approach to antibiotic therapy or to a standard approach. The antibiotic prescription rate was 72% lower in those who had procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use without any impact on patient outcome. However, Huang et al. conducted a study in 14 hospitals in the United States and among 1656 patients observed no significant difference between the PCT group and the usual-care group in antibiotic days (mean, 4.2 and 4.3 days, respectively) or the proportion of patients with adverse outcomes (11.7% and 13.1%, respectively) [19] . The bioMérieux's VIDAS ® BRAHMS PCT™ test has been developed and was approved by FDA in 2017 to differentiate bacterial from viral infections and ultimately whether antibiotics are needed for pneumonia (Table 1) [25]. An ongoing study (Targeted Reduction of Antibiotics using Procalcitonin; TRAP-LRTI) is evaluating outpatient adults with suspected LRTIs and low procalcitonin levels [26] . Low blood levels of PCT (≤0.25 ng/mL) using bioMérieux's VIDAS ® BRAHMS PCT™ test, which produces results within 20 min, is being used as an inclusion criterion, and then patients will be randomized to either azithromycin for 5 days or placebo. At Day 5, patients will be evaluated for improvement in symptoms with additional follow-up to 28 days after randomization. The study will evaluate the recovery of patients given azithromycin versus placebo, and whether a low PCT level can be used to avoid antibiotic therapy. The study will be completed in 2020, and it will add evidence to the utility of point-of-care PCT testing for patients with symptoms of LRTI in the outpatient setting [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
