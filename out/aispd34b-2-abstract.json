Total RNA from each parasite sample was extracted and cDNA synthesized. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers for all var genes. Samples for flow cytometry were labelled with rabbit IgG targeting DBL5Îµ of VAR2CSA and serum IgG from malaria-exposed men and pregnant women.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
