G4 is the first reported S2-targeting antibody and its epitope consists of a glycosylated, solvent-exposed loop residing in a connector domain between the HR1 and HR2 of the S2 subunit. In the unbound spike trimer structure this loop is largely disordered, whereas it extends out from two Î²-strands and is surrounded by all six CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of the mAb G4 upon antibody recognition (Figure 4(E) ). The specific spike-G4 interaction may stabilize the loop and further impede conformational changes of S2 subunit essential for membrane fusion after DPP4 binding. The binding epitope for G4 in S2 subunit is more conserved than RBD among MERS-CoV isolates, shedding light on G4 as a potential broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody for MERS-CoV. Yet this loop between HR1 and HR2 is variable in sequence and length among different viruses even in lineage C betacoronaviruses [33] , limiting its application to other coronaviruses. In terms of pan-coronavirus medical countermeasures (MCMs), the recently developed fusion inhibitor peptide EK1 is a potential candidate. The peptide EK1 was designed to target the more conserved HR1 region of the S2 stem, and was shown to block cell-cell fusion induced by spike protein from multiple human coronaviruses [30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
