Toward this end, we utilized our live infectious VSV recombinants; VSV-M40 and VSV-M40-P2728A [10] . Recombinant VSV-M40 expresses the WT L-domain motifs (PTAP-PEY) and flanking residues from eVP40 in place of the L-domain of VSV M protein and buds efficiently, whereas recombinant VSV-M40-P2728A expresses mutated eVP40 L-domain motifs (PTAAAEY) and is budding defective [10] . Briefly, HEK293T cells were first transfected with vector alone, BAG3-WT, or BAG3-ΔN for 24 hours, and then infected with either VSV-M40 or VSV-M40-P2728A at an MOI of 0.1 for 8 hours (peak time of budding). Infected cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot for expression controls, and virus production was quantified by standard plaque assay (Fig 10) . We found that the levels of infectious VSV-M40 released from mock-and BAG3-ΔN-transfected cells were virtually identical; however, titers of VSV-M40 released from cells expressing BAG3-WT were consistently and significantly reduced by >50% compared to controls (Fig 10A) . In contrast, expression of BAG3-WT did not have any significant effect on budding of mutant VSV-M40-P2728A (Fig 10C) . Importantly, these data demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of BAG3 on budding extends to infectious virus, and confirms the involvement of the viral PPxY/BAG3 WW-domain interaction in this negative regulatory mechanism.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
