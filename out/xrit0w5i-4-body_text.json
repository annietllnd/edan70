The type I interferon binds to interferon-α/β receptors and activates JAK-STAT signaling pathway, resulting in the expression of hundreds of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) [15] . Products of these genes are mostly antiviral proteins which are essential for mediating the antiviral state of the host. Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) were identified nearly 30 years ago, and although other functions have been proposed, the primary role of IFITM proteins seems to be antiviral. IFITM proteins are a family of small transmembrane proteins that are induced strongly by interferon, but that are also expressed basally in several cell types and lines [16, 17] . To date, three IFITM proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have been identified to display broad spectrum antiviral activity in human and mice [18, 19] . Especially, the IFITM1 and IFITM3 were proven to be more effective in resisting influenza virus infection [20, 21] . The siRNA-mediated depletion of IFITMs significantly increased H1N1 virus titers in primary lung fibroblasts and in HeLa cells, while overexpression of IFITM1, 2, 3 could improve resistance to the H3N2 influenza in A549 and MDCK cell lines [22] . Although the antiviral activity of IFITMs has been identified in multiple types of cells, the antiviral activity of IFITM1 has not been reported in endothelial cells infected with H9N2 virus or inoculated with inactivated viral particle.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
