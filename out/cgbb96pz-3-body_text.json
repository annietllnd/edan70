Depletion of RanBP2 negatively affects HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and nuclear import [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although HIV-1 can use other redundant pathways for import, pathways not involving RanBP2 lead to suboptimal chromosomal integration sites for the HIV-1 genome [4, 7] . The interaction between RanBP2 and HIV-1 may not occur strictly at the nuclear pore. It was recently reported that the Kinesin-1 motor, KIF5B, relocalizes RanBP2 to the cytoplasm during infection [10] . As summarized in Table 1 , RanBP2 seems to be generally important for the replication of HIV-1 and HIV-2, but not as important for the replication of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from monkeys. RanBP2 depletion does not alter infection with SIVmac [3-9, [11] [12] [13] HIV-2 Yes TRIM-RanCyp restriction assay Yes [8, 9] SIVmac macaque No 1. TRIM-RanCyp restriction assay 2.
