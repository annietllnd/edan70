The peak of the level of viremia in all experimental groups was observed at 7th dpi. Moreover, at the same time point the most severe clinical lesions (measured by an objective clinical scoring system) were observed in BOR group, while in other groups no or very mild clinical lesions were observed described in details in Stadejek et al. [18] . Therefore, samples collected at 7th dpi were submitted for further microarray study. EDTA-stabilized blood samples were collected from five pigs from each group and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by gradient density centrifugation using Histopaque 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich), frozen and stored at − 80 °C until further processing.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
