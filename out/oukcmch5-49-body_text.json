Sequences for BCoV (GI: 18033975), FIPV (GI: 556925469), HCoV-OC43 (GI: 530802591), HCoV-HKU1 (GI: 306569687), SARS-CoV (GI: 89474484), MERS-CoV (GI: 510937295), HCoV-229E (GI: 82780499), HCoV-NL63 (GI: 530802144), IBV-Beaudette (GI: 138186) were obtained from NCBI. Alignments were performed over the entire length of the spike proteins using MegAlign (Lasergene DNASTAR) using a ClustalW alignment, gap penalty 10, gap length penalty 0.2, delay divergent sequences 30%, DNA translation weight 0.5, protein weight matrix: PAM series, DNA weight matrix: ClustalW.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
