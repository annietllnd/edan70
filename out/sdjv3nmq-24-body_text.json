DF1 is not used here because phos-JNK antibody could not detect the expression of avian homolog(s) (data not shown). Also, the cleaved form of PARP could not be strongly detected by PARP antibody. Several studies by our group on stress response have used H1299 and Huh-7 cells 18, 28 . To be consistent with these previous experiments and to make study on signaling cross-talk between pathways possible, we chose to use the same cell lines in this study.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
