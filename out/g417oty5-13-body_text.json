In 2009 and 2011, HAdV-7d re-emerged in China after an approximately 20-year absence and caused two ARD outbreaks in children with a fatality 1, 7 . It was also the prevalent genome type in Japan during 1987 to 1992 46 and in Korea during two outbreaks in 1995-1996 and 2001-2002 47 , with a high fatality rate (18%) in children 48 . Recently, it emerged to cause adult severe CAP in the USA during 2013-2014 27, 32 . In our study, HAdV-7d caused more severe clinical manifestations and adverse consequences than other types, particularly HAdV-3 and HAdV-2 (61 and 12 cases, respectively), with longer duration of fever, higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea, pleural effusion, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and consciousness alteration, as well as with higher rates of pneumonia, mechanical ventilation and death. As there were relatively few cases of HAdV-14 and HAdV-55 infection in our samples, whether HAdV-7d can cause more severe clinical manifestations or adverse consequences than these latter two types is unknown. More cases will be collected for further analysis.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
