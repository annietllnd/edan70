Categorical variables were presented by using frequency and percentage. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the socio-demographic factors and KAP scores. The KAP assessment was carried out by assigning scores to the variables. To assess the role of socio-demographic characteristics on KAP, differences in socio-demographic status were compared with the KAP scores using ANOVA or independent sample t-test as appropriate. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to describe the strength and direction of the relationship among knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). Correlations were interpreted using the following criteria: 0-0.25 = weak correlation, 0.25-0.5 = fair correlation, 0.5-0.75 = good correlation and greater than 0.75 = excellent correlation [23] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
