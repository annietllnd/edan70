Expanding secondary structure methods to handle all pseudoknots typically costs far more computer resources [1, 4, 14] . Vsfold5 is a unique approach that makes it possible to transition directly to the pseudoknot (PK) problem. The worst case introduces at most a factor N to the computation time (known as time complexity), where N is the sequence length.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
