[18] . Primer pair coverage was extended to optimize quantitative measurement of mRNA transcribed from 59 full-length var genes and two pseudogenes in the NF54/ 3D7 genome. Two phenotypically distinct NF54-derived lines, NF54 (unselected) and NF54VAR2CSA (selected for VAR2CSA expression) showed abundance peaks of dominant and subdominant var transcripts at ring stage, although the relative abundance of the dominant transcript in each population was higher in ring stage and early trophozoites than in schizonts. This can be explained by the increased uncertainty of measurement when transcript abundance is very low.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
