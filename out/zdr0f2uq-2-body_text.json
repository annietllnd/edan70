Numerous enveloped viral pathogens, have evolved to take advantage of host-cell processes, including glycosylation pathways, to decorate the surface of their proteins with "self" glycan moieties. The analysis of viral glycosylation across different families has revealed significant variation in the structure, density and conservation of glycans. Understanding the endogenous functionality and the immunological basis driving viral diversity has the promise of guiding the development of the next generation of vaccines and anti-virals. Here, we will discuss the varying roles that glycosylation plays in the viral lifecycle and host immune responses to infection. Viral glycosylation has been investigated in the context of a number of envelope glycoproteins, including the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) [2] [3] [4] , hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) of influenza virus [5] [6] [7] , coronavirus glycoprotein spike (S) [8] [9] [10] , glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus [11, 12] , glycoprotein complex (GPC) of Lassa virus [13] , and envelope (E) glycoprotein of dengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses [14, 15] . However, glycosylation on viruses is not limited to envelope glycoproteins. Many secreted viral proteins present glycans which are necessary for their respective functions, such as the non-structural protein-1 (NS1) of flaviviruses [16] , the secreted GP of Ebola [17] , and the secreted glycoprotein G (sgG) of herpes simplex virus (HSV) [18] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
