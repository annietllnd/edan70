The most commonly used frameshift reporter is a tandem luciferase construct where the two luciferases with different substrate specificities are separated by a stretch of nucleotides of a length that shifts the downstream luciferase either one nucleotide up or down (Grentzmann et al., 1998) . The downstream luciferase will be expressed only if the nucleotide stretch can mediate frameshifting, while the upstream luciferase serves as an expression control. Alternative reporter genes include the use of fluorescent proteins (Cardno et al., 2009) , although the dynamic range of luciferases is generally much higher. This reporter can be used experimentally to confirm predicted frameshift events.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
