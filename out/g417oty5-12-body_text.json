The relationship between the two strains merits further investigation. Another study in Northern China found that HAdV-55 had higher pneumonia severity index scores in adolescent and adult patients compared with those with other types 3 . However, due to the difference both in case number of each type and in the age groups, the severity of illness caused by HAdV-7 and -55 cannot be compared between their study and ours. Moreover, a high rate of HAdV co-infections (36.8%) with other respiratory viruses was also found. The dominant pathogens co-infected with HAdV were RSV, HBoV, HPIV and HCoV, which was similar to a report from Northern China 42 . However, no statistically significant difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data between HAdV co-infection and HAdV single infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
