We used glutaraldehyde to crosslink the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex, FLASH NTD C54S/C83A, and FLASH NTD and analyzed it on SDS-PAGE (S5 Fig). We observed the strong presence of dimers for both FLASH wild-type and C54S/C83A double mutant and weaker presence of higher oligomers (trimer, tetramer etc.). The higher oligomers became less apparent at lower concentration (0.01 mg/mL) of the protein, suggesting that they are probably due to random collisions of monomer/dimer in solution. Dimer and trimer species were also observed for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex but Lsm11 NTD did not appear to be substantially crosslinked to FLASH or to itself, possibly due to the fact that it has only one lysine residue. Therefore, we conclude that the dimer and trimer species for the complex were probably crosslinked FLASH, as observed for the FLASH alone samples, and the cross-linking experiments by themselves did not provide conclusive information about the stoichiometry of FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
