Consider that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was recently created in order to "finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious disease epidemics" [7] . For epidemics that loom on the horizon, developing vaccines without being able to test them on populations who are naturally exposed to a disease is difficult. Because HCTs involve isolating strains of a disease and deliberately infecting participants with the disease in a controlled environment, they make it possible to study interventions for infectious diseases in advance of outbreaks.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
