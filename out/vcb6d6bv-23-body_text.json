These residues are extremely unfavorable within the lipid bilayer. Their presence in TM segments is significantly abated (Figure 4) [14] . As a consequence, their contribution to the folding/packing of TM segments will be limited. However, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are not completely avoided in TM helix-helix interactions (see M2 below) [72, 73] . The energy penalty of inserting a polar residue could be compensated by the presence of highly hydrophobic residues. Furthermore, if the polar interaction is formed before partition into the lipid core, which would require a concerted mechanism of insertion (see above) and a close proximity between the implicated residues (see below), the energy penalty could be greatly eliminated. Notably, when salt bridges or hydrogen bonds occur, their contribution to the folding/packing of TM segments is substantial [74] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
