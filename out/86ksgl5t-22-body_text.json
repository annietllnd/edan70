The analysis of the three subgroups confirmed that IFN-λ3 most substantially upregulated the expression of ISGs (Figure 6) . Specifically, IFN-λ3 upregulated the expression of large distinct classes of ISGs in the classical ISG subgroup, such as MX2, ISG15, and IFIT3, the ISG fold changes induced by IFN-λ3 were up to nearly 10-fold higher than those induced by IFN-α ( Figure 6A ). The analysis of the weakly IFN-λ3induced gene subgroup showed that the expression of OASL, OAS1, and ISG12 (A) was induced by both IFN-λ3 and IFNα to significantly different levels. The OASL and OAS1 fold changes induced by IFN-λ3 were up to 8-fold greater than those induced by IFN-α ( Figure 6B ). More substantial fold changes in the expression of ISGs in the strongly IFN-λ3-induced gene subgroup were obtained with IFN-λ3 compared with IFN-α, which resulted in only slight changes in expression ( Figure 6C ). The differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. P < 0.05 was considered significant, and the p values are expressed as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, and ****p < 0.001.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
