Metagenomic sequencing-based shotgun diagnostics do not compare the sample to known organisms or resistance patterns in internal databases. Rather, these shotgun metagenomics methods involve extraction of total DNA and/or RNA (usually followed by conversion to DNA) from primary specimens, fragmentation, library preparation, and depth sequencing [58] . Charalampous, et al. report on an optimized nanopore sequencing-based clinical metagenomics test (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), which removed approximately 99.99% of host DNA from clinical respiratory samples (a challenging specimen given the low pathogen load compared with the backdrop of host nucleic acids (up to 1:10 5 in sputum)), enabling pathogen genome assemblies equivalent to whole genome sequencing of isolates within 48 h [59] . This would allow for identification of new pathogen emergence, unusual resistance patterns, as well as outbreak assessment. This method of testing currently remains in development.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
