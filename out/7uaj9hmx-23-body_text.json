PRRSV infection significantly increased intracellular ROS (Fig 5) . Tulathromycin treatment abolished PRRSV and LPS-induced intracellular ROS production, however, it did notrestore ROS levels to control values in cells exposed to both LPS and PRRSV (Fig 5) . Interestingly, intracellular ROS levels were significantly lower in MDMs incubated with LPS and PRRSV compared to MDMs stimulated only with LPS (Fig 5) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
