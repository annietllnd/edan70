Table 4 shows the total cost of each milk source with 6, 8, 10, and 12 L allotments. As milk allotment per calf increased, the cost of milk increased. The cost of pasteurizing whole milk ranged from 10 to 18% of the total cost of feeding calves in applicable scenarios. This model assumed the same nutritional value and gain from milk replacer and whole milk, creating a limitation in the model. However, calves fed pasteurized or unpasteurized whole milk have been shown to increase model-produced ADG by at least 0.03 kg/day with the potential to be over 0.25 kg/day of gain in comparison to milk replacer [15] . The additional cost to feed whole milk has the potential to be offset by an increase in weight gain.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
