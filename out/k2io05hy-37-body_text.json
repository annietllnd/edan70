The antiserum identified a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 12 kDa in BTV-8 infected cells, which is close to the molecular weight calculated for NS4, from the sequence of Seg-9 (,10 kDa). The anti-BTV NS4 antiserum is therefore specific to NS4 and does not cross react with other viral proteins. Western blot analysis using non-infected BHK-21 cells, showed that anti-BTV NS4 rabbit antiserum does not cross react with cellular proteins. A similar analysis, using antisera raised against recombinant GIV NS4, identified a protein of approximately 20 kDa in GIV infected cells (figure 5), corresponding to the theoretical molecular weight of NS4 deduced from the sequence of GIV Seg-9. The anti-GIV NS4 antiserum is therefore specific to GIV NS4 and does not cross react with other viral proteins. Western blot analysis using non-infected BHK-21 cells, showed that anti-GIV NS4 rabbit antiserum does not cross react with cellular proteins. Western blot analyses of purified BTV virus particles showed no reaction with anti-BTV NS4 antibodies, indicating that NS4 is 'non-structural' ( figure 6A, 6B ). Figure 7 shows infected and non-infected BHK-21 cells probed with anti-BTV-8 VP2 antibodies raised in mice. Figure 8 shows infected and non-infected BHK-21 cells probed with anti-BTV8 immune serum from experimentally infected mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
