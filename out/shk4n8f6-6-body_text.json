To test whether this complex forms in HCV-infected cells, we overexpressed ATG12-Flag in infected and uninfected cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-flag monoclonal antibody, we detected the ATG5-12/16L1 complex under both conditions (Fig. 1B) . Whereas ATG5-12 associates spontaneously with ATG16L1 37,38 , our results indicated that HCV infection did not disturb the formation of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
