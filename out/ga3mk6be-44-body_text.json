Other dsRNA viruses such as rotaviruses, use different mechanisms (which vary between strains and the type of infected cells) to modulate the type I IFN response. For example, rotaviruses use NSP1 protein to promote the proteasome-dependent degradation of IRF proteins [75] [76] [77] and mediate repression of NF-kB, resulting in a reduction of IFN induction [78] . Rotaviruses also induce shut off of cellular protein synthesis resulting from the detection of dsRNA by PKR which, in turn is responsible for phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a [79] . The blocking of host cell protein synthesis is another likely strategy used by some RNA viruses to counteract the IFN response [67, 68] . BTV also blocks host cell protein synthesis early after infection, although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not clear [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
