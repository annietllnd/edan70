Briefly, Each 20-ml of mouse sera serially diluted 4-fold was transferred into flat-bottom 96-well plates containing 5 ml of MP-12 virus (50 pfu/well) (final dilutions of sera: 1:10, 1:40, 1:160,). After incubation at 37uC for 1 hour, 150 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS was added to the well. The 150 ml of the mixture was transferred into a 24-well plate with confluent VeroE6 cells, and the plate was incubated at 37uC for 1 hour. After removal of inocula, virus titer was determined by plaque assay. Eighty % of the average number of plaques in 6 different wells that had mockimmunized mice sera was used as the cut-off number (typically 8, 9) . The highest dilution of sera that produced the number of plaques below the cut-off number was designated as the PRNT 80 neutralizing antibody titer.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
