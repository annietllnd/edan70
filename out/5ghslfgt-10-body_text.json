Figures 1 and 2 contain the estimated ranges of cumulative case counts from 5-and 10-day forecasts for Guangdong and Zhejiang, respectively. 10-day ahead forecasts from each model with the reported calibration data are shown in references [9, 14] . We refit the models to each of the M = 200 datasets generated by the bootstrap approach, resulting in M best-fit parameter sets that are used to construct the 95% confidence intervals for each parameter. Further, each model solution is used to generate m = 30 additional simulations extended through a 10-day forecasting period. We construct the 95% prediction intervals for forecasts with these 6000 (M Ã— m) curves.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
