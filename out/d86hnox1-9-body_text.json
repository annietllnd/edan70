We consider the F = −2 case first. The DNA sequence to be optimized is the region of X′, Y′ overlap. We number the X′ codons in this region in the 5′ → 3′ direction (the direction of the polypeptide sequence). For each X′ codon c X (k), we denote c Y (k) the Y′ codon on the opposite strand that has two overlapping nucleotides. The two codons c X (k) and c Y (k) define a quartet of nucleotides on the X′ strand, which we denote Q k , shown in Fig. 2A . The following quartet Q k+1 shares its first nucleotide with Q k : Q k+1 (1) = Q k (4), so that the sequences of any two consecutive quartets are linked 17 . The key step is to express the DNA sequence, not as a series of codons but as a series of quartets, whose sequences will be varied subject to the linkage constraint. This representation of the DNA sequence is shown in Fig. 2B .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
