In the absence of an effective vaccine, direct administration of H7N9neutralizing antibodies could be used as an intervention to prevent H7N9 infections in humans. This approach could be especially helpful for those at high risk for contracting H7N9. When administered prophylactically, HNIgGA6 conferred 100% protection in virus-infected mice 22 , supporting this rationale. Alternatively, the RBS-directed neutralizing antibody HNIgGA6 can be used together with other antiviral drugs (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) to control the production of the escape mutants that limit the effectiveness of these NA inhibitors 10, 11 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
