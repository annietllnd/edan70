The results show that there was almost no change in the gene expression profile in the cells expressing VP1, except five genes which were dysregulated. (The results of RNA-seq were provided as Supplementary Material.) Among the genes with altered expression levels are HSPA1A (GenBank: KY500386.1) and HSPA1B (GenBank: KY500397.1), which encode the chaperone protein heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) and Hsp70-2, respectively. The expression of Hsp70 was confirmed by RT-qPCR ( Figure 4A ) and Western blotting (Figures 4B,C) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
