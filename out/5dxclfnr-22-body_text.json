For this purpose Akt interferes with pro-apoptotic molecules to inhibit their activity either through a direct phosphorylation of the regulators as in the case of several Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins (e.g., BAD), or indirectly through the phosphorylation of certain transcription factors such as FOXO1 which thereupon translocate out of the nucleus and thus can no longer promote the transcription of their pro-apoptotic target genes [52, 53] (Figure 4) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
