Based on the observation that fragment 2 is a potent activator of bis-electrophile 1 inducing the assembly of an irreversible protease inhibitor, a set of fragment combinations was designed, varying the chemical nature and the attachment of the protein-reactive electrophile (Fig. 4 , Table 1,  Supplementary Table 1 ). Trans-epoxide 3 was a moderately active irreversible inhibitor of the protease (k inact /K I ¼ 3.7 M À 1 s À 1 ), while trans-epoxide 4 was a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. Cis-epoxide 5 was inactive as expected, so was the naphtyl-1-methyl amide 6, which was designed according to a recent report 40 . Increased reactivity with the protease was observed, when alternative electrophiles were linked to the primary fragment 2. While the acrylic ester derivative 7 was only a weak irreversible inhibitor with k inact /K I to 0.4 M À 1 s À 1 , the ethyl fumaroyl electrophile in 8, containing also a trans-olefine, raised the relative inactivation rate to 132 M À 1 s À 1 , more than 60-fold than the initial electrophile 1. The same electrophile, an N-fumaroyl ester, was inactive in the 5-amino position as shown by compound 9. Converting the stereochemistry at the double bond of 9 furnished the N-maleoyl ester 12 displaying an impressive inactivation rate of 606 M À 1 s À 1 . To assure that the inhibition of 12 was effected by the amino-pyrazolone fragment, the unsubstituted maleoyl amide ester 13 was prepared and found to be only moderately active (34 M À 1 s À 1 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
