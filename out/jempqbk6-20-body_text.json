It is 99% identical to the Escherichia coli transposase, and its GC content is more similar to that of E. coli than to that of the phage itself (0.507 for the protein, 0.532 for E. coli, 0.360 for the phage). Thus, we can reasonably assume that this domain was introduced into Enterobacteria phage If1 from its host.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
