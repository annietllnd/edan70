To take a potential age influence into account, FIP cats and cats with systemic diseases were subsequently each compared to young (Group 2.2a) and old (Group 2.2b) control cats. Within Group 2.1, FIP cases were split into those with and without effusions. These were first compared to each other and then separately to control cats, age subgroups of the control cats, and cats with systemic inflammatory diseases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
