First, we compared the density of synonymous and nonsynonymous generegion SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes to those of other genes on chromosome 19. Although the density of synonymous SNPs within CEACAM/PSG genes was similar to the average of other genes, the density of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes was significantly higher than that of the rest of genes on chromosome 19 (Table 1 , p,0.01). Consistently, whereas 40% of CEACAM/ PSG genes contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP, only 8.3% of the 1,363 other genes on chromosome 19 contained nonsynonymous SNPs (Table 2 ). These data suggested that CEACAM/ PSGs are enriched with genetic diversity in the coding region.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
