In cats, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α are the main mediators of the acute phase inflammatory response [8] and cats with FIP exhibit clear clinical and histological evidence of overt inflammatory processes. Despite this, there are conflicting results on the presence and systemic levels of these cytokines in FIP. Early studies found high IL-1 and IL-6 activity in sera, ascitic fluid, and the supernatant of cultured peritoneal exudate cells of cats with FIP [9,10]. However, IL-6 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were found to be unaltered, only mildly increased, or variable in FIP [11] [12] [13] , whilst IL-10 and IL-12 transcription was markedly depressed [11] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
