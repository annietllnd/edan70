Extracted nucleic acid (5 L) was then added to each well. The cycling program was as follows: denaturation at 95 ∘ C for 10 min; amplification for 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 ∘ C, 15 s at 55 ∘ C (single acquisition), and 15 s at 72 ∘ C; melting curve analysis for 30 s at 95 ∘ C, 10 s at 59 ∘ C, 15 s at 45 ∘ C (ramp rate of 0.1 ∘ C/s), and 0 s at 80 ∘ C (ramp rate of 0.14 ∘ C/s and continuous acquisition); and cooling for 30 s at 40 ∘ C. Positive and negative controls were included in each run. The positive control consisted of the abovementioned plasmids in S.T.A.R. buffer : sterile water (1 : 1) at a concentration of 1,000 targets/ L. The negative control consisted of 1,000 colony forming units of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 S.T.A.R. buffer : sterile water (1 : 1) at a concentration of 1,000 targets/ L.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
