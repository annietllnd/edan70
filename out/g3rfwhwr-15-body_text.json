A first taxonomic assignment of these contig datasets was performed, on the basis of BLASTn (E value #10e-03) or BLASTx (E value #1000) analysis, after Velvet and CLC de novo assemblies, respectively. At this stage, the proportion of viral contigs was low, accounting for less than 2% of the total number of contigs ( Table 2 ). These two types of contigs were pooled for each sample and analyzed for taxonomic classification ( Fig. 1A and 1B) . The limited number of contigs obtained with Velvet was offset by classifying unassembled reads in a similar manner after BLASTn analysis. Virus-related reads accounted for less than 0.2% of all raw read sequences, consistent with the findings of previous metagenomic studies in bats based on Illumina sequencing (Table 2) [17, 20, 22] . Viral composition differed both between and within bat species ( Fig. 1A and 2A ). The proportions of unassigned viral contig sequences and read sequences were 22% and 32% (mean values), respectively. Most contigs had low levels of nucleotide or aminoacid similarity to known viral sequences from the databases queried, suggesting that these sequences corresponded to previously unknown or genetically distant viruses, as reported in previous bat viral metagenomics studies [16] [17] [18] [20] [21] [22] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
