There is correlation between macrophage morphology and function, hence providing an easy way to monitor Immuno-modulating properties of Tulathromycin in PRRSV-infected porcine monocyte-derived macrophages changes in macrophage polarization [41] . In this study we found that PRRSV infection dramatically altered monocyte-derived macrophage morphology, inducing an elongated phenotype with numerous cytoplasmic pseudopods. Recent findings indicate that these pseudopods promote intercellular junctions allowing PRRSV to evade host immunity through direct intercellular spread [59] . Tulathromycin pre-treatment was sufficient to prevent the PRRSVinduced pseudopod formation and morphological alterations in macrophages. Whether TUL may prevent intercellular junctions and thus hinder PRRSV immune evasion requires more research.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
