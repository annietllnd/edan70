An autochthonous case of DENV infection was reported in Tokyo, Japan, in 2014 for the first time in 70 years (Kutsuna et al., 2015) . To ensure prompt action in response to a DENV outbreak, a comprehensive DENV database based on the genotypes would be essential for tracing the outbreak source. To date, only two DENV databases provide genotype information. The web service ViPR 1 (Pickett et al., 2012) supports genetic analysis based on the viral genome for a tested input sequence, including DENV sequences. The second database is the Dengue virus genotyping database 2 (Yamashita et al., 2013) , which provides a summary table containing the DENV serotype/genotype, year and country of collection and accession number. There are many other DENV databases; however, no other sites provide summarized genotype information. The Dengue Virus Resource 3 facilitates the retrieval of DENV sequences deposited in GenBank according to serotype, disease symptom, host, region/country, genome region, and collection and/or release data (Resch et al., 2009) . DENVirDB 4 provides sequence information and computationally curated information of dengue viral proteins (Asnet et al., 2014) . DENVDB focuses on the dengue virus sequence database for keyword searches (no publication: http://proline.bic.nus.edu.sg/denvdb/). Finally, the Dengue Virus Portal is a sequence collection with metadata (no publication: https://www.broadinstitute.org/ annotation/viral/Dengue/Home.html).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
