The NTA sensorchip was regenerated between cycles using 350 mM EDTA and 100 mM NaOH followed by 0.5 mM NiCl 2 . A sample containing 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.05% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare) (HBS-P+) was injected over the SARS-CoV S and reference flow cells, followed by injections of purified ACE2 serially diluted 2-fold from 100 nM to 6.25 nM in HBS-P+, with a duplication Electron microscopy data collection. 3 µL of 0.47 mg/mL of protein or protein complexes were mixed with 1 µL of 0.04% (w/v) amphipol A8-35 (Anatrace) just prior to grid preparation. 3 µL of the protein mixture, final concentration 0.35 mg/mL, was spotted on to plasma cleaned C-flat grids with a 2 µm/2 µm spacing. Grids were blotted for 3 seconds before plunge freezing in liquid ethane on a Vitrobot. Grids were loaded onto a Titan Krios and data was collected using Leginon 42 at a total dose of 65 e − /Å 2 . Frames were aligned with MotionCor2 (UCSF) 43 implemented in the Appion workflow 44 . Particles were selected using DoG picker 45 . Images were assessed and particle picks were masked using EM Hole Punch 46 . The CTF for each image was estimated using Gctf 47 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
