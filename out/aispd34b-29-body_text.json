However, var1csa transcription was not detected in any stages in NF54VAR2CSA. This observation is most simply explained by a var1csa-expressing subpopulation of NF54 having been removed by VAR2CSA selection. This interpretation further entails that only one var gene is transcribed per infected erythrocyte and the var1csa gene is restrained from transcription by the silencing mechanisms operating on all var genes that is imposed when another var gene, in this case var2csa, is expressed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
