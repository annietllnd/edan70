Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably excreted (RANTES), dsRNA dependent protein kinase R (PKR), indolamine 2,3-deoxygenase, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and TLR3 are also induced [29, 46, 47] . IL-18 is involved in controlling influenza virus replication in the lung, especially at early stages of infection, through activation of innate immune mechanisms including IFN production and NK cell activation [48] . IL-2, produced by T cells specific for influenza A virus, is involved in T cell dependent IFN-production by NK cells, suggesting that at an early stage of recurrent viral infection, NK-mediated innate immunity to the virus is enhanced by pre-existing virus specific T cells [49] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
