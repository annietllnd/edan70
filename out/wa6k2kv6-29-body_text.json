However, it is widely known that a clinical diagnosis of influenza is not straightforward, and it is difficult to find symptoms or combination of symptoms specific for influenza [20, 30] . We found that cough was significantly associated with influenza A (x2, p,0.001). This is consistent with the results of Boivin, of Ohmit and of Monto, who reported that cough and a fever.38uC were associated with a positive PCR test in the influenza population, when influenza was prevalent within the community [7, 31, 32] . Our specimens were collected during the influenza season in Beijing and the cough appears to be specific for influenza in this cohort. This is also consistent with the view of Call et al, who believe that both fever and cough are more specific for influenza among elderly individuals when influenza virus is circulating in an area [30] . We did not find any statistically significant difference in the occurrence of fever (temperature .39uC) between the FLU-A-positive group and the FLU-Anegative group (x 2 , p.0.05). A study that involved all age groups demonstrated that muscle and joint pain and headache were associated with influenza [20] . However, we did not find any statistically significant differences in the occurrence of muscle and joint pain, and headache between the FLU-A-positive group and the FLU-A-negative group (x 2 , p.0.05).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
