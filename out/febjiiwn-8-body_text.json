Honey bees from 20 colonies were consistently sampled beginning with the introduction of a new queen in April 2009 (Mississippi (MS), through transport to summer foraging grounds in South Dakota (SD), and transfer to California (CA) for almond pollination (Figure 1 ). During our study, these colonies were exposed to antimicrobial treatments, transportation stress, different pollen and nectar sources, and three distinct geographic locations: MS, SD, and CA, (U.S.A.).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
