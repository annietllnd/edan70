Comparison on the structural level adds viral structural proteins (capsid, envelope) and some protein-and RNA-modifying enzymes (proteases, methyltransferases) to this pool. Thus, we observe a network of evolutionary links between the proteins that perform very basic biochemical and structural functions in different virus families.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
