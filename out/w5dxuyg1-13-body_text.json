For the liver, RT-qPCR for feline IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and TNF-α was carried out on the cDNA samples, using previously published assays [21, 36, 37] . For the heart, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α transcription was assessed. The mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as internal controls. All reactions were run in duplicate, using previously published amplification conditions and assay compositions [21, 35, 37] . Briefly, the thermal profile was as follows: 50 • C for 2 min, 95 • C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 • C for 10 s, and 60 • C for 1 min. Data collection occurred during the extension phase (60 • C).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
