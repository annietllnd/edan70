Huh7 cells were reverse transfected in a 24-well plate with siRNA (25 nM final concentration) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Huh7 cells were transfected with siRNA to GFP, LC3B siRNA (UACCUGUAUACGUUAGUGAAAUU) or with an ON-TARGETplus human ATG7 siRNA-SMART pool (catalog no. L-020112-00-0005). To study the onset of replication, Huh7.5 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA, as described above, in 6-well plates. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were trypsinized, washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in 100 μ l of cold Ingenio electroporation solution (Mirus) and then electroporated with 5 μg of in vitro-transcribed viral RNA (JFH1/Fluc or JFH1/Fluc-GND) in 2 mm gap electroporation cuvettes by using a BTX Harvard Apparatus with the following settings: 820 V, 99 μ S, 4 pulses, 1.1 s interval. The cells were then resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS and seeded in 96-well plates and further cultured for 24 h. The cells were then lysed in 20 μ l luciferase lysis buffer (RLB) and stored at − 80 °C until measurement of luciferase activity. For the determination of intra-and extracellular virus titers, JFH1-infected Huh7 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA in 6-well plates. Two days later, the cells were washed three times with PBS and supplemented with fresh DMEM. After 24 h, cells and supernatants were harvested. The cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in 1 ml culture medium and subjected to 3 rapid freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice/ethanol bath and 37 °C water bath, respectively. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes. Samples were analyzed using a limiting dilution assay.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
