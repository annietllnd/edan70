When labeling for both expression and affinity, PCSK9 conjugated with Biotin (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) was also added at a final concentration of 20 nm and detected with Streptavidin conjugated with DyeLight 488 or APC 635. After incubation with detection antibodies/reagents the cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in 100 μl of PBS for flow cytometric analysis and sorting (when required). The labeled cells were kept on ice and protected from light throughout the experiment.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
