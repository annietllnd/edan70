However, it was not clear how the immune response differentiated between dying and recovering mice. In order to explain these variable immune responses, we previously showed that specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires were present in dying mice during TBEV infection [65] . Furthermore, we also showed that specific TCR repertoires were detected in the dying mice compared with the recovering mice following JaOArS982 infection (Shirai, et al., unpublished results). These data raise the possibility that there may be a variety of specific T cell clones effecting either protective or pathogenetic functions in dying and recovering mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
