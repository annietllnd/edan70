Supernatants and infected cell extracts were harvested at 8 hours post-infection. Released VSV-M40 and VSV-M40-P2728A virions were titrated in duplicate via standard plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Cellular proteins were detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies. ", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
