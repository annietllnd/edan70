To confirm the role of Hsp70 in CVB3 infection, viral replication was determined in the cells with the knockdown of Hsp70. As shown in Figure 6C , knockdown of Hsp70 dramatically reduced the level of viral 3D pol , indicating that Hsp70, which is up-regulated in CVB3infected cells, facilitates viral replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
