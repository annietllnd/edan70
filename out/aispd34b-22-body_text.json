This indicates both that the two sets of primers were recognizing the same transcript and that most, if not all, detectable transcripts were already spliced ( Figure 4) . The difference in Î”Ct value between the primer sets for PFL0935c ( Figure   4A ) was most likely due to differential primer bias.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
