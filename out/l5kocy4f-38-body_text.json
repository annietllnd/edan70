Cells were then collected via low speed centrifugation. The cytosol, organelle membrane and plasma membrane protein fractions were isolated sequentially using the "Minute plasma membrane protein isolation kit" (INVENT) following the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins within the cytosol and plasma membrane fractions were detected via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The β-actin and sodium potassium ATPase were used as cytosol and plasma membrane controls and were detected using mouse anti β-actin (SIGMA) and rabbit anti Na/K ATPase (ABCAM) monoclonal antibodies.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
