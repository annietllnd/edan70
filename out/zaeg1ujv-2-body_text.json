It is a nonenveloped RNA virus with a genome composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which replicates in cytoplasmic structures composed primarily of viral proteins (3) (4) (5) . During infection, the first steps of viral morphogenesis and genome replication occur within cytoplasmic viral replication factories known as viroplasms (3, (5) (6) (7) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
