Since the exact boundary between the ectodomain and the stem-TM domain is unclear, we constructed three E truncation mutants lacking the predicted stem-TM domain in three recombinant viruses, rVSV-E404, rVSV-E414, and rVSV-E415 which express the N-terminal 404, 414, and 415 amino acids of the E protein, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). Next, rVSVs expressing E and E deletions with anchor C (signal peptide) were generated ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). These recombinant viruses were named rVSV-aE, rVSV-aE404, rVSV-aE414, and rVSV-aE415. We also constructed four recombinant viruses that would coexpress anchor C-prM with E, or the same E deletions, as a polyprotein ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). In addition, since the NS1 protein of other flaviviruses has been shown to play a role in protection 21, 25, 44 , we constructed rVSV-prM-E-NS1 which expresses prM, E, and NS1 as a polyprotein ( Supplementary  Fig. 1A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
