The mean grayscale value of the anti-IgG minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 96.2 (P = 0.003). The mean value of the anti-IgM minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 8.15 (P = 0.29). These data are indicative of the specific interactions between the anti-IgG and the human IgG immobilized on the chip, which could be used as references to determine whether the antibodies in samples are IgG.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
