The virus was isolated and passaged in the allantoic cavity of tenday-old embryonated hens' eggs at 37uC. The allantoic fluid was harvested 72 h after inoculation, pooled and stored in stored in aliquots at 280C until use. The infectious virus titer of the resulting seed stock was determined by TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) and the titer calculated by Reed and Muench [46] and confirmed by plaque assay on MDCK cells. Passage E2 was used for the studies reported herein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
