These constructs allowed us to compare the immunogenicity of various combinations of ZIKV wild-type and mutant proteins, all including the E protein since it is known in other flaviviruses to be the main target for neutralizing antibody (Ab) 43 . ZIKV E protein is composed of an N-terminal ectodomain, consisting of three domains (I, II, and III), and a stem and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain ( Supplementary  Fig. 1A ) 13, 43 . The major neutralizing epitopes are located in the ectodomain of the E protein.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
