Furthermore, mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs showed significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies and anti-N IgG than those vaccinated with rMP12-NSsR173A ( Fig. 7B and  C) . None of the survived mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs showed a decrease in body weight below 90% (Fig. S3) . The results suggest that rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs have slightly higher efficacy than MP-12 and induce neutralizing antibodies at equivalent level to those induced by MP-12 in spite of a lack of PKR degradation function.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
