Phosphorylation of JNK and Akt is likely induced by the SARS-CoV N protein, and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-xL proteins may also contribute to the persistent infection [74] . In contrast, JNK signaling has been found to facilitate apoptotic cell death in IBV-infected cells [37] . Therefore, it is possible that JNK serves different functions in cells infected with different coronaviruses, and presumably at different stages of infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
