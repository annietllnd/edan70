We expressed JSRV Env in 293T effector cells stably expressing GFP, and labeled HTX/LH2SN target cells expressing IFITM proteins with a red-fluorescent dye, CMTMR; cell-cell fusion was measured by a fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry [27] . Similar to the syncytia formation results (Fig. 3A) , IFITM1 exhibited the strongest inhibition, reducing the cell-cell fusion efficiency of JSRV Env by ,50% (Figs. 4A, B and C; p,0.01). IFITM2 and 3 also suppressed cell-cell fusion, but with much less efficiency (Figs. 4A, B and C; p,0.01). Given that the sizes of fused cells in parental HTX/LH2SN cells were much larger than those of fused cells in IFITM1-expressing cells (Fig. 4A) , and that the cell populations with larger size were excluded from flow cytometry analysis, it is likely that the percent of fusion reduction measured by flow cytometry (Figs. 4B and C) underestimates the inhibitory effect of IFITM proteins (see another cell-cell fusion assay below). Nevertheless, these experiments provide clear indication that the content transfer resulting from cell-cell fusion by JSRV Env was inhibited by IFITM proteins.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
