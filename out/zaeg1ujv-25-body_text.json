We therefore asked whether an MA104 stable cell line expressing the deletion mutant NSP5/Δ3 (MA-Δ3) and infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain was able to trigger hyperphosphorylation of NSP5/S67A and, as a consequence, sustain replication of the mutant rRV strain. As shown in Fig. 8B  (lanes 5 and 6) , NSP5/S67A was hyperphosphorylated in the presence of the NSP5/Δ3 mutant, which was confirmed by the Ppase treatment (Fig. 8D) , although it did not completely rescue the phosphorylation pattern of NSP5 normally observed in rRV-wt infection. When loading large amounts of NSP5/S67A, we have occasionally observed a second faint band with reduced mobility, as seen in Fig. 8B , lane 2 (indicated with an asterisk). Interestingly, regular round structures resembling viroplasms, containing NSP5, NSP2, and VP2 with peripheral localization of VP6, were recovered in these cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A, and yet viral replication was nevertheless impaired (Fig.  8E and F) . Consistently, the electron microscopy images showed structures of aberrant viroplasms similar to those obtained in MA104 wt cells (Fig. 7B, right panel) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
