It protects by producing hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that modulate diverse biological functions. A number of ISGs (such as PKR, RNase L, ISG 15, etc.) have been characterized and shown to suppress viral replication, the mechanisms of which are still poorly defined (reviewed in reference [1] ). One exciting development in the last few years has been the discovery of some novel ISGs, also known as cellular restriction factors (such as APOBEC3G, Trim5a and Tetherin, etc.), which intrinsically block different steps of retroviral replication [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . It is notable that many viruses, including retroviruses, have evolved to acquire a variety of strategies that evade IFN-mediated restrictions [7, 8, 9] . This type of intrinsic immunity is believed to play crucial roles in virus-host co-evolution and viral pathogenesis [7, 10] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
