In group T04 (water for injection), six of the 11 cats were positive for FeLV p27 antigen on day 652, three weeks after challenge. Of these six, three cats remained positive for FeLV p27 antigen until the end of the study. Of the 11 animals in this treatment group five (45.5%) met the criteria for persistent antigenaemia.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
