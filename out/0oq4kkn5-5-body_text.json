As a protein target, the 3C protease of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3 3C protease) was selected 23, 24 . Coxsackie viruses are members of the large genus of enteroviruses, representing uncoated positive-strand RNA viruses of the picornavirus family and causing numerous human diseases including meningitis, myocarditis and diarrhea [25] [26] [27] [28] . The genus Enterovirus comprises numerous human pathogens, including rhinoviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other humaninfecting viruses like EV-A71 and EV-B93 (refs 26,29,30) . Coxsackie virus 3C protease, like other enteroviral proteases, is a cysteine protease with a characteristic specificity for glutamine in the P1 position of its substrates (Fig. 1b) . Thus, for this target, fragments binding to the S1 pocket are biomimetics of the glutamine side chain, while the active-site nucleophile is the thiolate of cysteine 147 (Cys-147).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
