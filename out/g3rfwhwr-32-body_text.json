{"cord_uid":"g3rfwhwr", "sourcedb":"PMC", "sourceid":"PMC3906132", "divid":30, "text":"Short sequences related to the L gene of bornavirus were identified in various tissue samples (brain, liver or lungs) collected from most of the bat specimens analyzed (b1-b6, b9) . Surprisingly, all were identical or highly similar, and displayed high levels of amino-acid similarity to a bornavirus-related sequence recently discovered in the genome of Myotis lucifugus [54] . This suggests that these sequences may also be endogenous. It has been shown that similar endogenous bornavirus-related sequences can be expressed as mRNAs in other vertebrate models [55, 76] . Their presence and expression may confer some biological advantage on their hosts, such as natural resistance to the disease caused by the pathogen concerned [54] . This may account for the presence of these bornaviral sequences in all common pipistrelle specimens (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) tested and in two other bat species (Hypsugo savii and Myotis nattereri) of the five analyzed. However, screening for bornavirus-related sequences should be extended to other bat species.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
