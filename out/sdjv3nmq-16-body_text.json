Both phos-c-Jun and total c-Jun was reduced in c-Jun-knockdown cells, as compared with siEGFP control (Fig. 7a, b) . Surprisingly, although knockdown of c-Jun did not significantly affect IBV replication, a significantly higher percentage of PARP cleavage was detected in c-Jun-knockdown cells compared with siEGFP control of the same time point. So, unlike JNK, c-Jun appeared to protect infected cells from apoptosis during IBV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
