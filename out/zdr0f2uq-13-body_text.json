Glycans can be structurally integrated into the protein fold and exhibit significant glycan-protein interactions to stabilise the protein, for example by increasing the solubility of proteins and interacting with surface hydrophobic residues. In addition, glycans can also assist glycoprotein folding by mediating chaperone interactions during biosynthesis [70] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
