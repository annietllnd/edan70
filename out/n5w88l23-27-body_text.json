Combating diseases caused by infections resistant to all antibacterial options requires the development of clinically useful small-molecule antibiotics and identification of novel targets. DNA metabolism is one of the most basic biological functions that should be a prime target in antibiotic development. Considering that dihydropyrimidinase is a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism required for metabolizing the DNA base, blocking this enzyme's activity may be useful to limit bacterial growth and survival. Although some chelators are known to inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, they are harmful to humans. In this study, we showed that dihydromyricetin, a flavonol, significantly inhibited the catalytic activities of dihydropyrimidinase toward both the natural substrate dihydrouracil and xenobiotic substrate 5-propyl-hydantoin (Fig 3) . Furthermore, the metabolic effects and safety of the flavonols are well established, making flavonols beneficial for humans. Thus, some of these plant polyphenols may become the lead compounds for further antibiotic development and drug design.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
