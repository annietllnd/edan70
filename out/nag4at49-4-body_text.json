Glycoengineered Pichia pastoris has been successfully used for production of monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic development [17] [18] [19] [20] . Here, we describe a dual-mode technique for engineering and production of full-length mAbs in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris. This approach preserves cosecretion of full-length unmodified bivalent mAbs into culture medium while utilizing the natural antibody biogenesis pathway to covalently display monovalent functional half IgG molecules on the cell wall. This facilitates the simultaneous selection of an antibody sequence with desired binding properties and its subsequent production in the same host. In addition, we also describe the first attempt to utilize this approach alongside haploid yeast mating by combining full-length heavy chain and full-length light chain libraries and the application of this display system to mature the expressibility of a monoclonal antibody lead while maintaining its affinity.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
