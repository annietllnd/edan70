In addition, no significant increases of viral propagation were observed in the peripheral and CNS tissues. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-α KO mice. However, high inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-α KO mice. In particular, perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL, which are known to be associated with immune-mediated neurodegeneration, were significantly increased in the brains of TNF-α KO mice when compared with those of WT mice. These observations suggest that immunopathological effects contribute to the severe neuronal degeneration and fatal disease in TNF-α KO mice.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
