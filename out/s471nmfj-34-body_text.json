HSF1, which is the key transcription regulator that binds the heat shock response element upstream of the promoter of HSPA (the gene coding Hsp70) (Chou et al., 2012) . In addition, it is implicated that the activation of HSF1 is also regulated by Hsp70. HSF1 basally interacts with Hsp70, and this interaction was interrupted by stress when misfolded proteins compete with HSF1 for the binding of Hsp70 (Zheng et al., 2016) . Phosphorylation, while as a positive factor that facilitates the activation of HSF1, seems not play a critical role (Zheng et al., 2016) . It has been shown that Hsp70 interacts with P1, the capsid precursor of poliovirus and CVB1 (Macejak and Sarnow, 1992) . Based on the reported studies and our results, we postulate that, in addition to the up-regulated phosphorylation of HSF1, VP1 of CVB3 might interfere with the interaction between HSF1 and Hsp70 through binding to either one of these proteins, leading to the release and activation of HSF1.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
