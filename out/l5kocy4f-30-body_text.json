The plasmids encoding eVP40-WT, eVP40-ΔPT/PY were described previously [2, 72, 73] . Flag-tagged mVP40-WT and PPxY mutant mVP40(P>A) were kindly provided by S. Becker (Institut für Virologie, Marburg, Germany). The pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-WT (1-575), pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-ΔN (62-575) and pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-ΔC (1-420) plasmids were kindly provided by K. Khalili (Temple University). Plasmid pDEST-mCherry-BAG3 was kindly provided by E. Sjøttem (University of Tromsø). mCherry-hLC3B-pcDNA3.1 was a gift from David Rubinsztein (Addgene plasmid # 40827) [74].", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
