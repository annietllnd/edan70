By June 11, the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert level to its highest level, declaring the first influenza pandemic in over 40 years [1] . Unlike seasonal influenza viruses, this novel H1N1 pandemic strain (H1N1pdm) tended to affect younger healthier populations and had an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [2] [3] [4] with 12-30% of the population developing clinical influenza, 4% of those requiring hospital admission, and 1 in 5 requiring critical care [5] . In general, however, infection of the H1N1pdm was relatively mild in most persons, although a fatal viral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in approximately 18,000 cases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
