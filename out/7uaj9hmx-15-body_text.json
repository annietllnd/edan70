MDMs were treated with vehicle medium alone (control) or with tulathromycin (1mg/mL) for 30 minutes. Cells were then infected with PRRSV for 2, 6, 12 or 24h (m.o.i. 0.1) or supplemented with control medium, and 1% Triton X 100 in media was used as positive control. Supernatants were collected and processed following manufacturer's instructions. A SpectraMax M2e microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure LDH concentrations in each sample at 492 nm. Necrosis was expressed as the absorbance ratios of the experimental cell lysates versus absorbances from controls arbitrarily set at 1.0 (100%). All experimental groups were assessed in duplicates.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
