The present findings also illustrate that TUL and PRRSV haver additive pro-apoptotic effects. Morevoer, the data indicate that PRRSV leads to cell necrosis, an effect that was inhibited by TUL. Necrosis is known to exacerbate local inflammation, to induce the release of cytotoxic molecules, and to lead to extensive tissue damage, while cell apoptosis contributes to the resolution of inflammation [62, 63] . More research in live PRRSV-infected animals will help determine whether TUL is able to promote the resolution of PRRSV-induced pulmonary inflammation at least in part via such a mechanism, as well by shifting local cytokine release from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory mediators.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
