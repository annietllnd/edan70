Mouse CCL2 was detected using the Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each hippocampus and whole brain sample, 50 μL of neat homogenate was measured in duplicate. Serum samples were diluted twofold and measured in duplicate. Values were calculated from a standard curve included in every assay. Serum values are reported as per mL; tissue homogenate values were back-calculated to the total amount present in the entire animal.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
