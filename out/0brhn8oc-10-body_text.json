Most introns are removed by a ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. A subset of introns are self-cleaving, catalyzing their own removal from pre-mRNA without the aid of proteins [14] . One such class of introns are the group I self-splicing introns, with the most well-studied example being from the ciliate Tetrahymena. The structure of this ribozyme is made up of three helical domains, with many tertiary contacts between the domains [15] . The only portion of the RNA that spans all three helical domains is a pseudoknot belt that wraps around the molecule, base-pairing with all three helices [15] . The pseudoknot establishes the catalytic core of the group I self-splicing introns.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
