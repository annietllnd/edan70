To eradicate invading viruses quickly and efficiently, host has evolved highly conserved sensors, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1) , that recognize viral infections and, subsequently, trigger antiviral immune responses. PRRs, which include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), sense different pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from invading viruses. Upon engagement with their cognate ligands, PRRs can induce the activation of two different transcription factor-mediated pathways, IRF3 and NF-κB. IRF3 mediates the secretion of type I interferons (IFNs), which lead to the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2) . NF-κB initiates both the production of proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, as well as the initiation of inflammasome priming stage (see below).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
