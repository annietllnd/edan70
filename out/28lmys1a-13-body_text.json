Assumed average daily gains on each feeding plan (6, 8, 10 , and 12 L) are described in Table 2 , following the equation presented in NRC, 2001. The weaning weight was calculated by multiplying ADG by 65 days and adding the weight gain to BW. Feed cost was reported for three variables: total cost during the pre-weaning period, daily feed cost, and feed cost per kg of gain. Total feed cost included milk replacer or whole milk expenses and feeding equipment. Daily feed cost was derived from dividing total feed cost by weaning age (65 days). Daily feed cost was then used to calculate feed cost per kg of gain. Daily cost under each feeding plan was divided by ADG to determine the cost per kg of gain.
