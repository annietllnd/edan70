The vaccinated groups did not show persistent antigenaemia and thus it could be considered that the vaccine offered full protection against a subsequent challenge with virulent FeLV during the timescale of each study. This observation is offset by the fact that the adult control animals in each study did not succumb to the challenge infection in sufficient numbers with a maximum of 45.5% animals in the 20 month duration study showing persistent antigenaemia. Given that the FeLV challenge was administered to these cats when they were approximately 10 to 39 months of age, it is likely that some degree of age related immunity to FeLV infection may have been a factor in this low rate of persistent p27 antigenaemia in unvaccinated cats. Age related resistance to FeLV challenge has been reported previously [4, 6] and consequently this result was not unexpected. Indeed, one study by Hoover and others [10] showed a rapid decrease in susceptibility to experimental infection with FeLV, with 100% of newborn kittens able to be infected compared to 15% of cats aged 4 months or 1 year old. A recent study comparing FeLV vaccine efficacy challenged cats with a considerably smaller dose volume and titre and achieved persistent antigenaemia in seven of eight controls, as well as five of eight vaccinated cats at seven months of age [11] . The high rate of p27 antigenaemia observed in the additional kitten control groups, which were approximately 12 to 16 weeks of age when subjected to the same FeLV challenge as the older cats and at the same time, provides evidence that the chosen dose and route of administration for the FeLV material resulted in an effective and aggressive challenge.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
