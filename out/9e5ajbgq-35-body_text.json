Several individual factors encompassing three risk domains, including oral health behaviors and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary habits, were found to be more relevant factors associated with dental caries than socioeconomic factors. Our results were consistent with findings in developed world where poor brushing habits, lack of dental coverage in health insurance, and high consumption of sodas were predominantly associated with dental caries. Future research should focus on confirming some of the unique or globally relevant associated factors for dental caries identified in our study, including late adoption of brushing, frequent consumption of sugary snacks between meals, and consumption of fresh fruits and flavored milk. Our results support the development and implementation of public awareness campaigns or health education programs targeted at primary school children to promote good oral health behaviors, feeding practices, and dietary habits.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
