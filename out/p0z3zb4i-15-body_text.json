In Case 5, a high HSV-1 viral load from BAL fluids was ignored given the detection of Influenza A virus with S. aureus and Ps. aeruginosa. The patient improved on antibacterial treatment alone and was discharged. He was readmitted one month later with de-novo respiratory deterioration that resulted in the need for intubation after the administration of a series of antimicrobial courses that always excluded acyclovir. CT and a second BAL now showed ground glass opacities/ARDS and an even higher HSV-1 viral load. The patient died from ARDS before antiviral treatment could be initiated. Case 6 featured an unilateral bronchopneumonic infiltrate and was treated with standard antibacterial regimens until Mycobacterium kansasii grew from the initial BAL. Treatment was changed accordingly and the patient recovered without the administration of antivirals.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
