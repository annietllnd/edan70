In accordance with the earlier study, Nrf2 was reported to directly or indirectly alter the expression of approximately 15,000 genes, and the number of directly inducible genes has been estimated at 654. Interestingly, the inducible targets of Nrf2 are primarily categorized as antioxidant-related genes [201] . Therefore, a well-controlled adaptive change in gene expression as a response to stress via Nrf2 and the ARE is considered to be a key protective mechanism of homeostasis maintenance [203, 204] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
