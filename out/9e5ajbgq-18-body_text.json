The discrimination, calibration and overall performance of the final multivariate model was assessed using concordance statistic, Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and adjusted Cox and Snell R-square, respectively. The performance of final model with and without socioeconomic factors was compared based on adjusted Cox and Snell R-square, which indicates the proportion of variation explained by the covariates in the model. Statistical analyses that yielded a p value less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
