The survival curve was statistically analyzed with Log rank test, and the difference in the survival curves among mice immunized with MP-12, rMP12-NSsR173A, rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs were not statistically significant. A mockvaccinated mouse that survived after wt RVFV challenge did not show reduction of body weight by more than 5% (Fig. S2B) , and developed 1:2,560 of neutralizing antibody at 21 days post wt RVFV challenge (data not shown), while 7 to 20% drop in body weight was observed before euthanasia in 80% of mock-vaccinated moribund mice after wt RVFV challenge (Fig. S2A) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
