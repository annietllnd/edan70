Vero E6 cells were grown on coverslips and infected with rSARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.3 and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 24 hpi. Cells were labeled with antibodies specific for 3a protein (shown in green) or for Na ϩ /K ϩ ATPase (plasma membrane marker), rab5 (early endosome marker), rab7 (late endosome marker), and lamp-1 (lysosome marker) (shown in red). In all cases, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
