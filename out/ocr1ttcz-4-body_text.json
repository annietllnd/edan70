These vaccine candidates triggered various degrees of humoral and cellular immunity and protection in rodent and/or nonhuman primate models. Among these candidates, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, and inactivated vaccine have been initiated for clinical trials. Currently, all ZIKV subunit, DNA, and mRNA vaccines have been targeted on the E or prM-E antigen. Although these vaccine candidates are promising, exploration of other new and highly efficacious ZIKV vaccines is needed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
