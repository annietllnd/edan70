Ninety-six-well plates were first coated with 50 µl of highly purified ZIKV E or NS1 protein (MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA) (4 µg/ml, in 50 mM Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.6) per well at 4°C overnight, and then blocked with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, 1% W/V in PBS, 100 µl/well) at 37°C for 2 h. Subsequently, individual serum samples were tested for ZIKV-specific Ab on antigen-coated plates. Briefly, serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted and added to E or NS1 protein-coated wells. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the plates were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Tween (0.05%), followed by incubation with 50 µl of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Abs (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h. Plates were washed, developed with 100 µl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), stopped by 100 µl of H 2 SO 4 (2 mol/L), and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined by BioTek microplate reader. Endpoint titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had an absorbance value 2.1-folds greater than the background level (DMEM control). Ab titers were calculated by the geometric mean titers (GMT).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
