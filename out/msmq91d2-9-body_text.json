The PCR fragments of PTV Adames or SFSV NSs were cloned into pProT7-S(+) [51] in place of MP-12 NSs, designated as pProT7-S(+)PTNSs or pProT7-S(+)SFSNSs, respectively. Similarly, Flag-tag was added at the C-terminus of those NSs, and the resulting plasmids were designated as pProT7-S(+)PTNSs-Flag or pProT7-S(+)SFSNSs-Flag, respectively. The pcDNA3.1mycHisA plasmids encoding CAT [32] or NSs of PTV Adames or SFSV NSs (without tag) were generated, and designated as pcDNA3.1mycHisA-PTNSs or pcDNA3.1-mycHisA-SFSVNSs. For reporter assay, IFNb-pGL3 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. R. Lin at McGill Univ. [54] , 46IRF3-luc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. S. Ludwig at ZMBE, Westf√§ lische-Wilhelms-University [55] , and pPRDII-luc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Gale Jr. at Univ. of Washington [56] . The pRL-SV40 plasmid was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
