Following JEV infection, activated microglia play a significant role in the development of pathology by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α [32, 33] . Although these pro-inflammatory cytokines have dual roles, acting both as protectors and degenerators of neurons [31] , TNF-α is believed to be one of the key factors that mediate immunopathology in the CNS during encephalitic flavivirus infection. For example, it was suggested that TNF-α directly mediates neuronal apoptosis by the engagement of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), the TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) and neuronal death contributes to glial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation [31, 34, 35] . It was also shown that TNF-α and IL-1β mediate RANTES gene expression for the recruitment of immune cells and glutamate released by JEV-infected microglia, involves TNF-α signaling and contributes to neuronal death [36, 37] . On the other hand, other studies have shown that TNF-α has a protective role against WNV infections and restricts WNV pathogenesis by promoting trafficking of mononuclear leukocytes into the CNS [38, 39] . Furthermore, neuronal TNF-α expression during WNV encephalitis may be an adaptive response to diminish CXCL10-induced death [40] . At this stage of our knowledge, therefore, the precise role of the TNF-α response in encephalitic flaviviral pathogenesis remains to be clarified.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
