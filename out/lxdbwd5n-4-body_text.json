GA ( Figure 1 ) and glycyrrhetinic acid ( Figure 2 ) are well-characterized components of Gancao. GA has been developed as a hepatoprotective drug in China and Japan. GA can generate glycyrrhetinic acid through metabolic processes in the human body. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of GA are essentially the same as glycyrrhetinic acid [13] . GA, also called glycyrrhizin, is a triterpene glycoside from licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) and consists of one molecule of 18 [14, 15] . Glycyrrhizin is considered to be the major active component of Gancao as demonstrated by studies with experimental animal models [16] and clinical studies [17] . GA has been used clinically for more than 20 years in patients with chronic hepatitis in China and Japan [18] and shows a satisfactory therapeutic effect in many other diseases. GA is also widely used as a sweetening and flavoring agent in food.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
