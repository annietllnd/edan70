Quenching refers to the complex formation process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of the protein. The fluorescence emission spectra of dihydropyrimidinase were remarkably quenched with dihydromyricetin ( Fig 7A) and myricetin (Fig 7B) . Upon adding 50 μM myricetin and dihydromyricetin, the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase was quenched by 56.2% and 89.1%, respectively. As shown in Fig 7B, adding different concentrations of myricetin resulted in a red shift (~7 nm; λ max = 333.5-340.5 nm) in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (λ em ). Adding dihydromyricetin also caused a red shift in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (Fig 7A) , which was much more significant (~25 nm; λ max = 333.5-358.5 nm). These observations indicated that myricetin and dihydromyricetin interacted with dihydropyrimidinase, thereby suggesting that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could form stable complexes with dihydropyrimidinase. The K d values of dihydropyrimidinase bound to myricetin and dihydromyricetin, as determined through their titration curves (Fig 7C) , were 28.8 ± 2.2 and 22.6 ± 2.6 μM, respectively.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
