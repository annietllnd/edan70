Due to the immense genetic diversity across HIV-1, many broadly neutralising antibodies target conserved features across the envelope spike, namely the glycan shield. Many such antibodies have been characterised for HIV-1, that not only target regions of dense of glycosylation that generate mannose patches [146, 160, 161, 163, 164, 245, [300] [301] [302] [303] , but also hybrid-type [304] , and tri-and tetra-antennary complex type glycans [301] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
