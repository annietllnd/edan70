We fit the model to the "incidence" curve while presenting the cumulative curves for visualization. Reported data are available beginning 22 January 2020, so the calibration period includes daily data from 22 January-13 February 2020. We estimate the best-fit solution for each model using nonlinear least squares fitting, a process that yields the set of model parameters that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the model and the data. The initial conditions are set to the first data point, and initial parameter estimates can be found in Table S1 .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
