VP1, VP4 and VP6 are minor enzymatic proteins that are packaged along with the ten genome segments within the central space of the virus core [6, 7] . The orbivirus outer-capsid layer is composed of two additional structural proteins (VP2 and VP5 of BTV), which mediate cell-attachment and penetration during initiation of infection. These outer-capsid proteins are more variable than the core proteins and most of the non-structural proteins, and the specificity of their reactions with neutralising antibodies determines the virus serotype (as exemplified by VP2 of BTV [8] ). The relative number and locations of the BTV structural proteins have been determined in biochemical and structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography [7, 9, 10, 11, 12] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
