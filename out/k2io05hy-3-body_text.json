The three economically most important orbiviruses: Bluetongue virus (BTV) (the Orbivirus 'type-species') African horse sickness virus (AHSV) and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are all transmitted by Culicoides biting-midges [1] . Several tick-borne orbiviruses can infect humans, including members of the Changuinola virus, Corriparta virus, Lebombo virus, Orungo virus and Great island virus (GIV) species.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
