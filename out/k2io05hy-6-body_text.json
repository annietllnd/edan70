BTV NS2 can be phosphorylated by ubiquitous cellular kinases and is an important matrix protein of the granular viral inclusion bodies (VIB) that form within the cytoplasm of infected cells. VIB represent the primary site of virus replication and assembly. The smallest of the BTV non-structural proteins that were previously identified, are membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a, which are expressed in large amounts in insect cells, but not in mammalian cells. They are involved in the release of progeny virus particles from infected cells [15] . In some orbiviruses (e.g. AHSV) NS3/NS3a are highly variable and it has been suggested that they may be involved in determination of both vector competence and virulence [16] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
