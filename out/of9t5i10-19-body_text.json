Clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), headache, and hypoxemia. Typical laboratory findings include lymphopenia and mildly elevated aminotransferase levels, indicative of liver damage. Death may result from progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage. The typical clinical course of SARS involves an improvement in symptoms during the first week of infection, followed by worsening during the second week. Studies indicate that this worsening may be related to the patient's immune responses rather than to uncontrolled viral replication [79] . TLR signaling is important for SARS-Co-V recognition by the innate immune system since C57BL/6 mice which are resistant to SARS-Co-V strain MA15, are susceptible when MyD88 is genetically deleted [80] . SARS-Co-V is an inefficient activator of alveolar macrophages and respiratory DCs, therefore impairing anti-viral responses such as IFNproduction, endocytosis and T cell responses [81] . SARS-Co-V protein 7a inhibits translation of various cellular RNAs and is involved in induction of cellular stress responses, including apoptosis [82] . SARS-Co-V NSP15, on the other hand, inhibits apoptosis thus facilitating viral immune evasion and virus propagation [83] , Fig. (1) . Analysis of splenocytes from WT mice determined that non-T cells were responsible for the high TNF-and IFN-levels present following infection with coronavirus strain MHV-A59, which primarily infects the liver and brain. These high cytokine levels could be abrogated by addition of T cells, with cell-to-cell contact being required. Consequently, as would be expected, T-cell-or lymphocyte-deficient mice infected with this strain exhibited symptoms of cytokine storm [84] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
