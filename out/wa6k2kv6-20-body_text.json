In 2010, the overall level of outpatient consultations was less than that of 2009, particularly between May and December. From May 2009, when pH1N1 emerged in Beijing [11] , the capacity of the outpatient service of the Infectious Diseases Department of PKUPH increased rapidly. The peak in numbers attending the outpatient department occurred in November 2009. From then, the outpatient volume declined, reaching normal levels in the third month of 2010. The numbers of outpatients remained relatively stable in 2010. The volume again increased during November and December 2010, and peaked in January 2011.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
