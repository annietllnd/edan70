Depending upon the organism(s) present in the sample the resulting amplicons will be comprised of differing composition of bases (the number of A's, G's, C's and T's aka base count). When these amplicons are analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry the base count of the amplicons can be determined and compared to a database to identify the organism(s) present. Nucleic acid extracts from ticks were screened for tick-borne microorganisms with three variations of a broad-range PCR/ESI-MS assay ( Table 1) . Primer set A includes 16 primer pairs designed to detect and identify a wide and diverse range of bacterial species. Primer set B includes two primer pairs designed to detect all Babesia species [5] . Primer set C consists of nine primer pairs designed to detect a wide range of bacterial and protozoan tickborne pathogens that were previously described [5] . PCR amplicons were analyzed by electrospray ionization followed by time of flight mass spectrometry system (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines IL) as previously described [10, 13, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
