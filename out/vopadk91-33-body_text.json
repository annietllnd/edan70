However, other viral PBMs likely show a preference for distinct PDZ domains. There are 266 motifs present in more than 400 cellular protein isoforms, each containing between 1 and 13 PDZ domains (42) . As SARS-CoV E and 3a protein PBM sequences are different (DLLV and SVPL, respectively), they are likely to interact with different networks of PDZ-containing cellular proteins. The protein 3a PBM interaction with cellular PDZ proteins most likely induces a signaling pathway that either is not pathogenic for the host or is activated at a lower intensity due to a reduced affinity of the viral PBM for the cellular PDZ domain, explaining why viruses with or without the PBM of 3a showed no significant differences in pathogenicity. However, given that the protein 3a PBM is required for virus viability when full-length E protein is missing, it can be confirmed that the pathways activated by the protein 3a PBM have some impact on virus replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
