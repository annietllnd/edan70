In this endeavor, starting from an irreversible inhibitor with a relative inactivation rate of 2.4 M À 1 s À 1 for warhead 1, the combination with S1-binding fragment 2 furnished potent irreversible inhibitors for several Michael acceptors, most pronounced for (E)-olefines like compound 8 (k inact /K I ¼ 131.7 M À 1 s À 1 ), (Z)-olefines like compounds 12 and 14 (k inact /K I ¼ 606.4 and 63.1 M À 1 s À 1 , respectively), and vinyl sulfones such as inhibitor 20 (k inact /K I ¼ 1,007 M À 1 s À 1 ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
