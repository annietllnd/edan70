Of the 500 Pfam domains considered here, 183 were recognized by Superfamily as similar to a SCOP family. We considered the protein pairs (X, Y) where the shorter of the two, say X, is among these 183 domains, and where the predicted homolog pair (X′, Y′) has a low E p value. We submitted each homolog X′ to Superfamily. Notice that we only considered the shorter protein, since the longer protein Y has non-overlapping amino acids that make it easier to recognize. Thus, X′ represents a more stringent test. For all three reading frames, over 83% of the homologs X′ were correctly recognized by Superfamily, further supporting their similarity to natural sequences.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
