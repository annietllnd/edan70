Some of these approved panels provide semi-quantitative results, such as the BIOFIRE FilmArray System Pneumonia Panel plus, which reports levels of organism concentration in genome copies/mL for values above 10 3.5 copies/mL for 15 bacterial pathogens [38] . In addition, some NAATs can provide both viral and bacterial rapid assessments, which is particularly helpful in diagnosing LRTIs, namely pneumonia with infiltrate(s) on chest x-ray. Bacterial and viral coinfection certainly need to be ruled-out in patients with pneumonia. Therefore, this ability to determine both viral and bacterial etiologies is advantageous.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
