PRRSV-induced phagocytic inhibition was inhibited by tulathromycin (Figs 10B and 11B ). Tulathromycin treatment alone did not alter MDMs phagocytosis versus controls (Figs 10 and 11 ). During phagocytosis, macrophages can engulf multiple antigens at the same time [46, 47] . Additional experiments assessed MDMs that engulfed less than 5 particles (ie with basal phagocytic indices) versus cells that ingested more than 5 particles (i.e. with elevated phagocytic indices). PRRSV infection significantly reduced the number of cells with high phagocytic indeces, an effect that was abolished by tulathromycin (Figs 10C and 11C) . Tulathromycin inhibited the PRRSV-induced reduction of basal and high phagocytic indices (Figs 10 and 11 ). Tulathromycin alone did not change either of the MDMs phagocytic indices versus controls. The same results were obtained when the cells were infected for 2 hours (Fig 12) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
