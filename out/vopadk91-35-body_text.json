In addition, when SARS-CoV-ΔE was passaged in mice, it spontaneously gained an internal PBM in the 8a protein. PBMs are also phylogenetically conserved in proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV isolates from humans, civet cats, dromedary camels, and bats (Fig. S4) , further reinforcing the idea of the relevance of PBMs for coronavirus viability. Viral PBM-cellular PDZ interactions have been previously described in several viruses. For instance, the PBM of E6 oncoprotein from human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) interacts with several cellular proteins containing PDZ motifs, leading to tumorigenesis and virus dissemination (69) . On the other hand, different strains of rabies virus (RABV) include a variety of PBMs in the G protein that differentially contribute to viral virulence through activation of a variety of signaling pathways (70) . In the case of influenza virus, NS1 protein has a PBM located at its carboxy terminus that is possibly involved in enhanced virulence (71) . In addition, the vaccinia virus F11 protein has both a PDZ domain and a PBM, which influence viral spread (72) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
