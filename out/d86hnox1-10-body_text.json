Let N be the number of X′ codons, which is also the number of quartets. For any position k in the sequence, there are 4 4 = 256 possible quartets Q, which can be subdivided into four groups of 64, depending on their last nucleotide: Q(4) = A, C, G, or T. This nucleotide defines the "state" of the quartet:", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
