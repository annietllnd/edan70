Briefly, protein extracts from HEK293T cells expressing either eVP40-WT, eVP40-Î”PT/PY (PPxY deletion mutant), or mVP40-WT were incubated with beads containing GST alone or GST-BAG3WW (Fig 2) . Input and pulldown proteins were detected by Western blot. Indeed, we found that GST-BAG3WW, but not GST alone, pulled down eVP40 in a PPxY-dependent manner (Fig 2A, top right panel) , and also pulled down mVP40 that contains a single PPxY L-domain motif (Fig 2B, top right panel) . In sum, these data indicate that, compared to other PPxY-WW domain interactions interrogated previously [21] , the eVP40 PPxY motif possesses a relatively high and significant degree of specificity, suggesting that BAG3 is likely a novel, biologically relevant interactor with VP40 of EBOV and MARV.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
