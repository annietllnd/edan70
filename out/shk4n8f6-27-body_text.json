After 24 h, the monolayer of cells was washed with PBS, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed in 0.1 M cacodylate (Electron Microscopy Science) and incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide (Mecalab) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol/deionized water solutions (from 50% to 100%). The cells were then infiltrated with a 1:1 and 3:1 Epon 812 for 1 h for embedding and polymerized overnight in an oven at 60 °C. The polymerized blocks were trimmed, and 100 nm ultrathin sections cut with an UltraCut E ultramicrotome (Reichert Jung) and transferred onto 200-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Science) with formvar support film. The sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Science) for 8 min, then with lead citrate for 5 min (Fisher scientific). The cells were imaged with an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI company) operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and equipped with an AMT XR80C CCD camera. Vesicle size was measured using Image J (NIH).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
