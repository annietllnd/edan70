However, the model with two generations alone indicated that the outbreak came to an end with the latest estimate of a generation-dependent reproduction number (of generation 1) as large as 9.3; if this model result were true, the reproduction number of the subsequent generation (generation 2) had to abruptly drop to 0. As mentioned in the Results, regardless of the assumed number of generations, the latest estimate of R i was below the value of 1 because the epidemic came to an end in October 2014. However, using the model with two generations, this had to happen quite abruptly, with a drop from 9.3 to 0. Using the model with four generations, the mean generation time had to be 12 days, allowing only about 6 to 7 days from illness onset in an infected person to EIP in a mosquito to biting a susceptible person. Thus, there was some interplay between the assumed number of generations and the resulting estimates, i.e., as the number of generations increased, the generation time was estimated to be shorter. As long as we cannot specify the exact number of generations, the only approach to address relevant uncertainty is to use multiple models with different numbers of generations, to verify that our practical conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions would not change drastically by varying the number of generations.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
