(+)RNA4 levels were inhibited ,1.5-to 8-fold in these strains ( Fig. 3 and Table 5 ). In addition to the severe inhibition of (+)RNA4 accumulation in P TET -HSF1, P TET -PRE1, and P TET -RPT6, (2)RNA3 was inhibited 5.5-, 1.8-, and 5.5-fold in these strains, respectively ( Fig. 3 and Table S6 ). Interestingly, all five genes that inhibited BMV RNA replication (ESS1, HSF1, JAC1, PRE1, and RPT6) perform cellular functions that, in various ways, contribute to modulating host protein levels ( Table 4) .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
