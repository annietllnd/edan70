Here, we identify HSP70 homologs in several giant viruses and in four members of the Closteroviridae family ( Figure 2G ). While preserving their function in protein folding in the giant viruses [2] , these proteins have acquired additional functions in closteroviruses as tail integral components [53] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
