These form of valuable information provides insights into forest and wildlife management, serve as benchmark for fragmented forests and as indicator for climate change, assist with food web plotting in different environments (caves, trees, artificial structures and fragmented forests) and also assist with bioresource studies (like biotechnology and phenology).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
