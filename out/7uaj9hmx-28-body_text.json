Upon incubation with PRRSV, extracellular and intracellular viral particles were enumerated via plaque assay. Tulathromycin did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers in either of the cell models (Fig 13A and 13B ). To verify these results, MARC-145 cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-PRRSV nucleocapsid antibody SR30F antibody. Size and numbers of viral foci were calculated in presence or absence of tulathromycin ( Fig 13C) . Again, tulathromycin pre-treatment did not alter viral titers compared to exposure to PRRSV alone (Fig 13C and 13D ).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
