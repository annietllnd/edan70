In the context of HCTs, this is typically referred to as an "endemic setting," but perhaps a clearer way to describe it is that the participants should be drawn from a group already facing some background risk of infection. This may be a way of reducing the net risk to which research volunteers are exposed, since they are already at some level of risk of having the disease, and the difference is that they now will have nearcertainty of being infected.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
