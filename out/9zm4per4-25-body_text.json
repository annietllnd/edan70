When the domain size becomes very large, the entropy in this model discourages the formation of such domains. The model's behavior is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] where it is proposed that the secondary structure tends to form first followed by the tertiary structure. Its behavior is also consistent with the contact order model [26] [27] [28] where it is proposed that the time it takes for a structure to fold is largely dependent on the domain containing the sequence fragment with the largest number of monomers. This model is able to answer the issues raised in Ref. [26] where it was pointed out that there appears to be a correlation between prediction and the contact order model. For vsfold, this correlation is a consequence of the entropy in the model (see Ref. [13] and related references therein). Good predictions can often be obtained with a variety of parameterizations. Hence, the model tends to be stable.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
