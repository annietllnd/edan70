Similar to H1299, phosphorylation of endogenous Bcl2 was not observed, while phosphorylation of ectopic Bcl2 was Fig. 1a . b The culture supernatants in a were subjected to plaque assay analysis. Virus titers were expressed as the logarithm of plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of supernatants. Using Student's t test (two-tailed distribution and unequal variance) to analyze the data, asterisks indicated significant difference compared with DMSO control(*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). c Huh-7 cells were infected and treated with SP600125 at lower concentrations as in a. Western blot analysis and data quantification were performed as in a. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. d H1299 cells were infected and treated with SP600125 as in c.
