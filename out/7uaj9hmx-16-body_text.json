For extracellular counts, supernatants were harvested at 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours p.i and incubated with confluent MARC-145 cells for 96 h as described above. For intracellular counts, macrophages were washed twice with warm (37˚C) phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) and lysed with double distilled water exposure and thorough mixing. Cellular debris were spun down at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes and supernatants were harvested and incubated with confluent MARC-145 cells as described previously. PRRSV staining was performed to further characterize potential antiviral effects. MARC-145 cells were seeded in LabTek chamber slides, grown to 90% confluence and infected with PRRSV (m.o.i. 0.1) for 24h at 37˚C, 5% CO 2 . PRRSV foci numbers and size were revealed using the SR-30F antibody (RTI, LLC, Brooking, SD, USA). Fluorescence ratio was calculated using ImageJ. Five fields of view per well were counted per sample.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
