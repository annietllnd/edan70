After washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the wells were blocked with PBS-T containing 5% skim milk at 37uC for 2 hours. Then, wells were incubated with serum samples (2-fold dilutions for anti-N IgG, and 1:100 for anti-NSs IgG) at 37uC for 1 hour. Wells were washed for 3 times with PBS-T and reacted with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA) at 37uC for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T for 3 times, ABTS was added to wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the optical density (OD) at 405 nm was recorded. The cut-off value, 0.176, was defined as mean+26standard deviation of 24 normal mouse serum samples (1:400) for anti-N IgG, while the cut-off value of 0.204 was defined as mean+36 standard deviation of 24 normal mouse serum samples. The highest dilution of sera that made a OD value larger than the cutoff was designated as the anti-N antibody titer. Because the anti-NSs antibody level was low, an OD value of a 1:100 dilution was used for demonstrating the presence of anti-NSs antibody.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
