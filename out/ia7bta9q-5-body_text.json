The first model places the MTase domain off the RdRP ds-RNA channel, largely based on reverse genetics analysis [7] , and the second model has the two regions loosely associated in a drastically different relative orientation, relying on small-angle Xray scattering (SAXS) data [19] . With an aim to further the grip on NS5, we have crystallized the full-length JEV NS5 protein and solved a 2.6-Ã… resolution crystal structure. The structure provides the first high-resolution snapshot of the flavivirus NS5, elucidates conserved intra-molecular interactions between MTase and RdRP, and paves a way to dissect the versatile functions of NS5 in its natural form.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
