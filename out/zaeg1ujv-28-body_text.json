Most RV assembly intermediates, i.e., single-layered particles (cores) and double-layered particles (DLPs), are concentrated primarily in viroplasms. Following budding of DLPs into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the immature particles acquire a transient envelope, as well as the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7, resulting in a mature triple-layered virion. Moreover, downregulation of expression of the most abundant viroplasm-forming proteins, NSP5 and NSP2, severely impacts the formation of viroplasms and production of virus progeny (13, 15, 25, 31) . In light of these observations, viroplasms have long been recognized as essential compartments supporting RV replication.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
