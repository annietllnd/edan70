A total of 100 µl each dilution was analyzed in triplicate, using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and three control wells containing medium only were used as an absorbance reference. The cells were then incubated for 24 h. A total of 10 µl MTT reagent (0.25% MTT) was added to each well and the cells were further incubated for 4 h until a purple precipitate was observed. A total of 100 µl detergent reagent was added to each well and swirled gently, and the plate was then incubated in the dark overnight at room temperature. The absorbance in each well at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Finally, the data were recorded and the results were analyzed.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
