Besides sequences from Parvoviridae, 62% of sequences identified as members of the parvo NS1 family in our analysis are E1 proteins from Papillomaviridae, and three and six proteins come from Betaherpesvirinae and Adenoviridae, respectively. Each of these groups is located on a separate branch with a high bootstrap support. For all of these proteins, their annotation suggests their involvement in DNA replication, and the P-loop motif characteristic for ATP/GTP binding is well conserved in the whole family ( Figure 1C ) [44] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
