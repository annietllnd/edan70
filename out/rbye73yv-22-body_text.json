These facts show that the RBD in the S1 subunit is a major vulnerable site for antibody recognition and neutralization. To be note, the RBD is also the region where most naturally occurring mutations of the S glycoprotein occur. Currently, the comprehensively studied antibodies targeting the non-RBD region of the spike glycoprotein also include mAb 5F9 targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit [57] , as well as mAbs G2, CDC2-A2, CDC2-A10, JC57-13 and FIB-H1 targeting the non-RBD region of the S1 subunit [33, 50] . However, the detailed epitopes and specific mechanisms are still unclear for these antibodies. We expect that more antibodies with new neutralizing epitopes and/or mechanisms would be important for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
