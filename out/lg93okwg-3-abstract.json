Through yeast two-hybrid and pull-down studies, this region was found to interact with the N-terminal region of FLASH ( Fig 1B) [3]. FLASH, Fliceassociated huge protein, was originally discovered as a protein involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis [18] and later in regulation of expression of several genes, including oncogenes [19, 20] . Subsequent studies showed that FLASH localizes to Histone Locus Bodies in the nucleus, suggesting a role in expression of histone genes [21], and that it is essential for histone pre-mRNA processing [3] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
