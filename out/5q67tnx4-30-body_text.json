Gentamicin was identified as the drug of choice for treating Gram-negative gastroenteritis bacteria and parvoviral enteritis [35, 36] . This supports the maximum sensitive pattern of gentamicin in 95% of the puppies with HGE. Cefotaxime was found useful against few Grampositive and most of the Gram-negative microbes implicated in parvoviral enteritis [37] , which was in turn found to be sensitive in 20% of the affected puppies. The choice and response to antibiotics vary with each and individual animal, as the type and composition of gastrointestinal microflora are not similar in all the animals [38] which explain the varying sensitivity pattern observed in the study.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
