To investigate whether these phenomena were unique responses to H9N2 virus and viral particle in HUVECs, we performed the same experiments on epithelial cells synchronously. Our results showed that endothelial cells and epithelial cells shared different features. Consistent with a previous study [52] , H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation elevated the levels of type I interferon in BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 2 ). In addition, contrary to endothelial cells, H9N2 virus infection induced a higher level of IFITM1 in BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 1) . These data suggested that H9N2 virus or viral particle may stimulate the innate immune response via different ways in vivo.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
