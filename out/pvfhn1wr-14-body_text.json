[12] and modified according to findings from pilot testing on 50 included studies, which included the Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ)an instrument developed specifically for China. Variables of interest included basic information (first author, year of publication, study setting), study design, type of participants, recruitment method, sample information (varied between surveys and interventions), MHL tools (referring to questionnaires or scales used to measure any domain of MHL) and their validation, mental disorder targeted, and domains of MHL measured. For the latter, we extracted relevant information from each publication (as described in each full-text article or based on the contents of the relevant MHL tool) into a separate document, which was then imported into NVivo software (Version 12) for thematic analysis. Initial thematic analysis used the framework outlined by Jorm et al. [12] , which was then modified according to the new themes that emerged. As the MHL domains vary among different types of participants, MHL domains were firstly analysed according to the type of participant (i.e. lay people, professionals and patients/carers), followed by three broad categories of MHL (i.e. knowledge, beliefs and behaviours/skills), and then more detailed subthemes.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
