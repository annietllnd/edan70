This knowledge helps bridge the gap between the accepted understanding of FIP as an immune-mediated inflammatory disease and the seemingly limited contribution of primary immune organs to inflammatory cytokine production. It also provides avenues for further study into the role of these organs in other feline systemic diseases.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
