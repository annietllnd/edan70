The viral protein LMP2A activates mTOR1, most certainly via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway since the activation is sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin. This leads to an enhanced disassociation of 4E-BP from eIF4E and thus to an activation of the cap-dependent translation [90] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
