A point-of-care test of CRP and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) was used in 54 patients with pharyngitis or LRTIs to determine the etiology of the infection [29] . This combination characterized 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, 70% (7/10) with viral infection, along with 92% (22/24) negative for a bacterial or viral infection. However, this study was small, and further confirmation of this point of care test is needed. Another host-protein signature assay combines the results of tumor necrosis-factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interleukin-10, and CRP and produces a score of 0-100 using the ImmunoXpert™ software. ImmunoXpert™ scores of <35 indicate nonbacterial etiology, whereas scores of ≥65 predict bacterial infections including mixed viral/bacterial co-infections [30] . This assay has a sensitivity of 93% with a 91-94% specificity. The use of this assay was superior to using the biomarkers individually, so development is continuing for a point-of-care platform to provide results within 15 min [30] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
