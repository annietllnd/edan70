In patients with advanced cancer, optimal poly (ICLC) administration regimes were found to be those administered on an alternate-day schedule with gradual dose escalation. In these studies the maximum tolerated dose varied over a several hundredfold dose range [119] .", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
