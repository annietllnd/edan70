Imaging studies were compatible with viral pneumonitis, but in Case 4 infiltrates suggesting bronchopneumonia were also clearly present. The mucosa was macroscopically inflamed in both cases. While Case 3 had inclusion bodies on cytology, such studies were not pursued in Case 4 due to obvious bronchopneumonia. Both patients had a fatal outcome after a prolonged in-hospital stay despite adequate antiinfective treatment that included timely administration of acyclovir.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
