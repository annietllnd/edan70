The specific panel of cytokines, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-Î± as well as IL-10 and IL-12p40, was chosen based on their known effects and to assess their potential role in disease manifestation, as FIP is driven by activated monocytes and characterised by vascular inflammatory lesions and fever.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
