FLAG-tag MKK4 and MKK7 were determined by Western blot (Fig. 2a) . As expected, phos-MKK4 was significantly higher in infected cells transfected with FLAG-MKK4, compared with vectortransfected control (XJ-FLAG). Surprisingly, phos-MKK7 was detected at similar level in all infected cells, although a much higher level of total MKK7 was observed in FLAG-MKK7-transfected cells. It was possible that phos-MKK7 antibody only recognized endogenous, but not ectopically expressed phos-MKK7. Surprisingly, MKK4 overexpression slightly reduced IBV-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. In contrast, both phos-JNK and phos-c-Jun were detected at much higher levels in FLAG-MKK7-transfected IBV-infected cells, compared with vector control. Phos-JNK and phos-c-Jun in mockinfected cells were also slightly higher in FLAG-MKK7transfected cells. Transfection of MKK4 or MKK7 did not affect IBV replication, as similar IBV N protein was detected compared with vector control.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
