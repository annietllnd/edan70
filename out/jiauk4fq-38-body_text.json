Thus, the BVH-1 group calves display an increase in IL-1 synthesis by septal MΦs coinciding with the onset of platelet aggregation in the lungs (2 dpi). This, together with the subsequent action of TNFα, would favor the maintenance of the procoagulant setting. By contrast, BVDV/BHV-1 group calves, whilst exhibiting a higher number of IMΦsthe main producers of these cytokinesdisplayed inhibited IL-1 expression until 7 dpi, along with a minimal TNFα response. This impaired cytokine production, also observed at the systemic level [40] , indicates that the synergic action of both chemical mediators can be ruled out as a potential mechanism for inducing platelet aggregation in the co-infected group. Calves inoculated only with NCP BVDV (0 dpi for the BVDV/BHV-1 group) displayed greater expression of iNOS by septal MΦs than healthy calves [34, 35, 54] . However, following BHV-1 inoculation, BVDV/BHV-1 group calves exhibited an early decline in iNOS (1 dpi), an inflammatory mediator that limits the extent and duration of pathogen-induced platelet activation [55] . This finding, together with the moderate response of TNFα, may have favored the appearance of platelet aggregates in the early stages of the disease, and intense aggregation coinciding with the greatest decrease in iNOS levels (4 dpi).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
