In the first step, IgG was immobilized as ligand on the first and second columns. Simultaneously, CMV-3A was immobilized on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth columns. In the second step, sample No. 948 was added to the third and fourth columns, and sample No. 940 was added to the fifth and sixth columns. PBST buffer was added as blank control to remaining areas. In the third step, anti-IgG and anti-IgM were added to third and fourth rows to identify and confirm In the first step, IgG was immobilized as ligand on the first and second columns. CMV-3A was immobilized on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth columns. In the second step, PBST buffer was added as blank control to the corresponding areas in the image. Sample No. 948 was added to the third and fourth columns, and sample No. 940 was added to the fifth and sixth columns. In the third step, PBST buffer was added as blank control to the first areas in every column. Anti-IgG and anti-IgM were added to the third and fourth rows, respectively. if the antibody captured by the ligand was IgG or IgM. PBST buffer was added as blank control to remaining areas.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
