Intentions do predict behaviours to a certain degree [27] , but situational influences and unconscious or affective reactions are likely to have an independent effect. As such, additional research in controlled settings (i.e. behavioural laboratory) and in real life situations at the time of a new influenza outbreak is needed. The results of this study are derived from a crosssectional analysis. In reality, changes in the development of the pandemic and the reactions of others may influence people's behavioural responses.", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
