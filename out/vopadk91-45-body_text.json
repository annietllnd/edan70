Regions of the SARS-CoV genome corresponding to the 3a, E, and 8a genes were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Briefly, total RNA from infected cells or homogenized mouse lungs was collected and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For RT reactions, 100 ng of RNA, random oligonucleotide primers, and ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used. RT products were subsequently subjected to PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primer pairs: 24937-VS (GGCGAC ATTTCAGGCATTAACGC) and 26086-RS (GGCACGCTAGTAGTCGTCGTCGGC), which amplify the 3a gene; E-VS (CTCTTCAGGAGTTGCTAATCCAGCAATGG) and E-RS (TCCAGGAGTTGTTTAAGCTTCTCAACGGTA), which amplify nucleotides 26017 to 26447, including the E gene; and 27545-VS (GGAGGTTCAACAAGA GCTCTACTCGCC) and 28008-RS (GACAGTTGATAGTAACATTAGGTGTGC), amplifying a region that includes the 8a gene. Sequence assembly and comparison with the parent consensus sequence were performed with SeqMan software (Lasergene, Madison, WI).", "project":"cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations":[]}
